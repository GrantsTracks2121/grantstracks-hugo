## What's Geoart?
When some geocaches are published their coordinates on the map are different from the actual coordinates where the geocache is hidden. Geocachers need to figure out the coordinates by solving a puzzle or in the case of this series finding the actual coordinats hidden in the geocache description. All this means the cache can appear on the map in cool patterns; this is called "geoart". There are [great examples of geoart around the world](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ra7swz7sqY), and chipchic, with the help of her geocaching buddies after multiple outings, created yet one more.

Here's what the "Running of the Bulls" geocache series looked like on the map before the real coordinates were determined:
