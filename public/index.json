No I didn't run with actual bulls. If you thought you were going to be reading about that, I understand the confusion. This \u0026ldquo;Running of the Bulls\u0026rdquo; is a geocaching series near Edson, Alberta hidden by chipchic, a geocacher from the area. That \u0026ldquo; Running of the Bulls\u0026rdquo; is what some foolhardy people do in Spain and in areas of France during summer festivals. If these people aren\u0026rsquo;t candidates for individual Darwin Awards, I don\u0026rsquo;t know who is.\nRunning of the Bulls in the Hornbeck Rec. Area\u003e Running of the Bulls in the Hornbeck Rec. Area # My geocaching buddy Hugh and I planned a two-day, one-sleep trip to Edson to tackle as many of the Running of the Bulls series as we could. We knew that there were too many caches hidden over such a wide area that we\u0026rsquo;d never be able to find them all during one trip.\nAfter the drive to Edson from Edmonton (and for Hugh, a bit further from Leduc), we made our way to the northeast corner of the Hornbeck Recreation Area where the series is hidden. We thought these more remote caches would be the most challending of the bunch and so chose to tackle these first.\nAfter parking at a gas well site, we set of on the trek. We were met with overgrown, but completely walkable trails. And we frequently bellowed out the forest, which we hoped was empty of bears. What was it like? I think this movie produced by Relive tells the story better with video and images than I can with words. It give you a bird\u0026rsquo;s-eye view of our trek. Many of the pictures are the same as those in the image gallery below, but this puts the images in context on the map.\nRelive Movie of the Afternoon\u0026rsquo;s Outing\u003e Relive Movie of the Afternoon\u0026rsquo;s Outing # These are example of the containers we were looking for. Some we quick finds, while others took us a while.\nAnd we stopped along the way to take some \u0026ldquo;hero\u0026rdquo; shots:\nWe were right to think this section of the series would be on the more difficult side. The black diamond markers on the cross-country ski trails told us there plenty of hills ahead. Add to those a few water hazards we had to bushwhack around where the trail was completely flooded with water or consumed with swampy muskeg. All this made for a tiring trek.\nBut we made it, just as the sun was setting. We\u0026rsquo;d made the loop, found most, not all, of the caches we\u0026rsquo;d looked for and were ready for a good shower in our hotel rooms and a good night\u0026rsquo;s sleep.\nImage Gallery\u003e Image Gallery # Here are a few pictures from the outing today.\nAnd just for fun, at the beginning of the hike I tried a bit of photo trickery.

Well, no, but I was floating, and was happy to have stayed that way throughout the entire maiden \u0026ldquo;voyage\u0026rdquo; of my inflatable kayak this morning.\nAfter a couple of years of deliberating about purchasing a kayak, I finally broke down and bought one late in the fall of 2021. I decided on an inflatable kayak mainly because of the ease of transporting it to wherever I was going to use it. You simply take it out of its carrying bag, inflate the three separate chambers - bottom, right side and left side - attach a \u0026ldquo;skeg\u0026rdquo; to the bottom for better control and be on your way.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s the upside.\nThe kayak is inflated and ready to launch. The downside is what you have is essentially a streamlined, yet still bulky dingy, a water craft that isn\u0026rsquo;t really built for speed or appropriate for long trips. I decided I didn\u0026rsquo;t care very much about either speed or long trips so the ease of transportation won out in the end.\nAnd this week was the first time I\u0026rsquo;d actually used the kayak in the wild.\nA couple of days ago I drove out to Islet Lake in the Cooking Lake-Blackfoot Provincial Recreation Area , got the kayak inflated and proceeded to learn \u0026ldquo;on the job\u0026rdquo; as I attempted to launch the kayak with me it in and then paddle around the cove. I got about 150 meters from shore about 4 or 5 times that day and was happy with just having gotten out on the water. The wind was blowing in some big dark rain clouds from the north which cut my visit short that day.\nToday, I was out to the same spot much earlier in the morning and this time the lake water was like glass. It was liberating to \u0026ldquo;break free\u0026rdquo; from the 150 meter limit I was comfortable with a few days before. I made my way around a large island in the center of the lake and then generally meandered around to different small islands before heading back to where I\u0026rsquo;d launched.\nWater, Land and Sky This is on the east side of the largest, central island\nIt was lot of fun just finding myself in this \u0026ldquo;new\u0026rdquo; environment, and being able to view these island while drifting along in the water. I\u0026rsquo;d seen them from these angles before years ago but that was by walking between islands on the frozen lake during winter.\nAnd there was a surprise, when I reached my launching spot on the shoreline: I realized my left leg was pretty well completely \u0026ldquo;asleep\u0026rdquo;. That made getting out of the kayak interesting to say the least.\nI still have a lot to learn, no question there. My paddling technique feels closer to \u0026ldquo;flailing\u0026rdquo; than an actual paddling. But it\u0026rsquo;s a start.\nAll in all, it was a fun and successful first paddle flail.\nImage Gallery\u003e Image Gallery # The kayak deflated again after the paddle\n","date":"June 23, 2022","permalink":"/posts/kayaking-on-islet-lake/","section":"","summary":"My first forays in my inflatable kayak were tentative, but memorable all the same.","title":"Kayaking on Islet Lake"},{"content":"The Bluejay - Charron Community Cemetery is located northeast of Atmore, Alberta which is near the junction of Highway 55 and Highway 63.\nA simple white patriarchal cross The cemetery is tidy and well-maintained.

Most assume the hamlet was named after nearby Seven Person\u0026rsquo;s creek, which of course begs the question of how the creek got its name. There are a few legends about the origin of the creek\u0026rsquo;s name.\nOne holds that the area was the site of a clash between Blackfoot and Cree braves and seven Cree were killed. It\u0026rsquo;s not difficult to imagine who was telling this version of the story.\nAnother version, holds that while crossing the creek, a group of Blackfoot found seven unidentified bodies lying on the banks of the creek. The bodies were all bald, but not scalped and had no battle wounds. The group waited in the area for others to come to collect the bodies and while they did so the bodies remained fresh with no signs of decay.\nAfter no one came to claim the bodies, the group decided to leave the bodies where they were, and surround each with stone cairns.\nThe following spring they returned to the spot and found that both the bodies and stones remained as exactly they\u0026rsquo;d left them, the bodies not at all decomposed. Ever since then the creek has been known as Seven Persons Creek.\nFinally, yet another less \u0026ldquo;mythical\u0026rdquo; version holds that the creek was actually named after the small community of Seven Persons by a Canadian Pacific Railway tie gang. The town itself was named by this same gang who had come across seven rough graves not far from the tracks they were building.\nAs for the cemetery, well, it has definitely seen better days.

That\u0026rsquo;s what gives the whole area its unique character and it\u0026rsquo;s that character that keeps me returning to it time and again.\nExperiencing a simple walk in a place like this really can help ease the mind into the \u0026ldquo;going in\u0026rdquo; that John Muir mentions in the quotation above. It\u0026rsquo;s not guaranteed and it\u0026rsquo;s often fleeting, but the transition to such a state seems to happen more easily in this kind of place.\nThere\u0026rsquo;s evidence that others feel the same way. It\u0026rsquo;s the urge toward the \u0026ldquo;going in\u0026rdquo; that caused one person to bring an \u0026ldquo;assist\u0026rdquo; to help with the process: a small, plain, folding red chair.\nThe Ministik is a big place with many trailheads leading into its interior. But I think it\u0026rsquo;s fair to say the \u0026ldquo;front door\u0026rdquo; is a gate to a road that leads to a research compound owned by the University of Alberta.\nAnd after a twenty-minute walk down that road one can climb a small embankment to arrive at a lookout over Williams Lake. It\u0026rsquo;s a simple, beautiful scene.\nThe View From Red Chair Lookout For almost a decade now a small, red folding chair has been a constant sentinel at the lookout. The chair provides a place to sit down, slow down, unwind, and stay a bit longer as Muir decided to do in the quotation above. It\u0026rsquo;s the chance to experience a \u0026ldquo;going in.\u0026rdquo;\nRed Chair Lookout on OpenStreetMap The red chair has been such an enduring fixture of the place that a local contributor to OpenStreetMap has labeled the place \u0026ldquo;Red Chair Lookout\u0026rdquo;.\nThe red chair endures as something man-made in this ever-fluxing scene of grass, water and trees. Nature\u0026rsquo;s cycle of growth, death and dormancy continues around it as it shifts positions, moved by humans who visit so they can perhaps reconnect with the unseen force powering the cycle, a force they intuitively know they too are a part of.\nAnd before you read about it in the tabloids, I need to give you the honest truth about red chair: yes, it\u0026rsquo;s true, it does have a checkered past. But don\u0026rsquo;t judge it: I think you\u0026rsquo;ll agree it was merely an unwitting accessory to a crime.\nReturning from a hike in the Ministik, I once happened to meet a gentleman just he was leaving the lookout and it as it turns out he is person who brought the red chair to the lookout years ago. He had found a spot elsewhere in the sanctuary where some n\u0026rsquo;er-do-well thieves has been burning the sheathing off of copper wire. Near the remains of the spent fire was \u0026hellip; the red chair.\nSince this gentleman, who turns 82 this year, has been visiting the Ministik for four decades, it must have easily occurred to him to relocate the chair so as to put it to a more \u0026ldquo;upstanding\u0026rdquo; use at the lookout, far away from a life of crime. And people familiar with the spot are certainly glad he did.\nThe Red Chair: A Retrospective Gallery\u003e The Red Chair: A Retrospective Gallery # I\u0026rsquo;ve made it a point to capture an image of the view and the red chair itself whenever I passed Red Chair Lookout.

The story of that experience could be made more dramatic if two of us were hunched over walking into howling wind and pelting snow, icicles hanging on beards and eyeballs freezing in their sockets.\nThe actual experience was nothing like that, but there’s a story to be told about events well before the day of the journey in addition to the lake trudge experience itself.\nBefore we get to the actual trudge across the lake, just in case some readers aren’t familiar with how geocaching works, I should start with a short explanation.\nA Short Geocaching Primer\u003e A Short Geocaching Primer # Geocaching is built on a simple concept. Hide something with some sort of “logbook” in it. Record the coordinates of where you hid that thing. Post the coordinates on the geocaching.com site. Other people use those coordinates to guide them to the spot where you hid the thing. They find it, sign the logbook to prove they were physically there and also log the find on the geocaching website.\nThat’s all quite simple, right?\nIn fact, it’s so simple, it’s so “open-ended” that it allows geocachers - “cachers\u0026quot; for short - to make the hobby whatever they want it be. Cachers can make a cache easy to find after a long walk either down a hiking trail or up a mountain. They can make a cache purposefully difficult hard to find by disguising it somehow. They can make the cache easy to find but hard to get into: for example, some people with a “maker” bent build “gadget” caches that cachers have to figure how to open on the spot.\nSome hide “multi-stage” caches that require you to visit multiple stages before reaching the final cache. Usually there are two or three stages, but I’ve done one that is 21 stages and it was well worth the effort too.\n“Puzzle” Caches\u003e “Puzzle” Caches # The Domino puzzle cache page. Then there are geocaching puzzles. Instead of simply posting where the geocache is hidden, a puzzle cache (the proper name is actually “Mystery” cache) requires the working out of a puzzle in order to come up with the coordinates where the cache is hidden. Puzzles range from straightforward, fun and easy to dastardly, mind-boggling and difficult.\nThe geocache my geocaching buddy Hugh and I were on a mission to find today was a puzzle cache and to me, it was of the dastardly, mind-boggling and difficult sort. It is called “Domino Cache” and the puzzle creator was another geocaching buddy, Dwaine. During the pandemic isolation of 2020, to pass some of the time, I focused far more than usual on solving geocaching puzzles. I even spent time solving multiple level, one 10 levels, one 12 levels, one a more than slightly insane 50 levels. So I’m not completely unable to solve geocaching puzzles.\nBut I was completely unable to solve the puzzle we were going for today. I’d tried multiple times over the years and just couldn’t crack it. I even had very good hints from Dwaine about what to do. I just didn’t get it. After I shared my pain with Hugh, who I think it’s fair to say does not love geocaching puzzles, he solved it in very short order! I was so happy and relieved to hear that because I know that someday I had an outside chance to do something I’d been wanting to do literally for years: go find the Domino Cache I strongly suspected and now knew was hidden on an island in the middle of Thunder Lake near Barrhead, Alberta.\nThe Journey to Thunder Lake\u003e The Journey to Thunder Lake # We started off trip to Thunder Lake with Hugh leaving his car at my place and setting out in mine. Despite the pandemic, we’d decided to travel together in one car because each of us knew the other was being very careful and isolating as much as possible over the past months.\nDuring the drive from Edmonton, we stopped at a couple of geocaching find most, but not all we attempted. Finally it was time to check out how we were going to approach the cache. There was a possibility of simply driving out onto the ice with the car, something we’ve done that at different lakes while geocaching in the past. But when we got to the “dock” at Thunder Lake we saw no evidence of people driving out onto the ice to go ice-fishing or otherwise. There were old “sled” tracks but no vehicle tracks.\nThat made me, the driver, nervous. It might have been just fine to drive out onto the ice. But with no evidence that others were doing it, I wasn’t comfortable being the first.\nThe next option was to check out places to park and from that spot we’d make our way to the cache. The problem was the places we had in mind were inside the Provincial Park and we found the provincial park was locked up to vehicle traffic for the season.\nThe Hike Begins\u003e The Hike Begins # So we had no choice but to park at the locked gates at the entrance and walk in from there. Getting ready at the parking spot. First we had a road to walk on, which of course was easy going. We had a good chuckle as we passed the park registration building. A NO REFUNDS sign, complete with a misspelling, informed guests that no, they wouldn’t get a refund if they didn’t like the mosquitoes, if it rained or if it was too hot or too cold for them. The amusing sign at the entrance gate. The park staff must hear it all!\nSoon we were at the shoreline and time to venture out onto the ice. At first there was a little minor “post-holing”: our boots sank into the snow with each step. But in fairly short order that stopped with most of the snow was crusty from being wind swept on the open ice. Soon we caught a couple of “ski-doo” tracks which made the walking quite a bit easier and we were able to follow those tracks all the way to the island.\nThe Find\u003e The Find # Once near the island the map on my GPS receiver hinted that we might need to travel overland for a bit. But as we got closer it was clear that wasn’t the case: soon we were 20 meters away from where the cache was supposed to be.\nWe found the cache quickly (Phew!), exactly where it was supposed to be because both of our GPSr receivers read 2 meters while we standing beside the cache hiding spot. There’s an understood 3 meter margin of error when using these devices so the coordinates we had were obviously precise.\nGrant on the island after the find We had found the cache and as is the practice of the times, we each posed for victory photos both during and after the signing of the logbook stored in the geocache container.\nThe quest for the Domino Cache was completed. It’s fulfilling to finally reach a goal, to so something that you didn’t believe would ever happen. Personally, I\u0026rsquo;d had many \u0026ldquo;map-dreaming\u0026rdquo; sessions over the past few years wondering if I\u0026rsquo;d ever manage to come and find this cache.\nAnd that had just happened! 😁\nIt was the time for periodic “happy dances” to punctuate the trudging steps over the crusty, wind-swept ice back to land and the waiting car.\nPicture Gallery\u003e Picture Gallery # ","date":"March 12, 2021","permalink":"/posts/a-satisfying-hike-over-lake-ice-to-the-domino-puzzle-cache/","section":"","summary":"A geocaching buddy Hugh and I trudge across lake ice early in March, 2021 to get to an island on which a “puzzle” geocache was hidden.","title":"A Satisfying Hike Over Lake Ice to the Domino “Puzzle” Cache"},{"content":"Some movies stand out from the rest. Often that’s because they do a good job of dramatizing situations from which you can learn essential truths about the human condition. The Shawshank Redemption and Gravity both excellent example of doing just this and both are worthy of your time and attention.\nThese are very different movies, but they share one identical message at a crucial point in their plots: if one decides not work to improve present circumstances and instead simply passively accepts whatever circumstances fate has provided, one becomes essentially “dead.”\nIt’s a choice we humans are making constantly: do we chose the “safe” stasis or the risky path to “becoming” and growth.\nFirst, The Shawshank Redemption. The movie was adapted from Stephen King’s novella Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption and released in 1994. Although critics seemed impressed, and it was nominated for seven Oscars that year, but won none. And it “landed with a hollow thud at the box office,” in the words of the director, Frank Darabont.” Since then, however, this movie it has grown in popularity to the point where it is the highest rated movie on IMDB.com and has been for years.\nWhy the initial cool reception by the general public? Most people probably assumed the movie that is set in a prison that depicts the lives of prisoners was a movie about prison life and the lives of prisoners. It’s not that at all.\nIt’s a movie about life, any human’s life …in a metaphorical prison of the someone’s own making. This is not the kind of prison that has walls. It’s a psychological prison we either build for ourselves or allow others to build for us.\nThe main character is Andy Dufresne, played by Tim Robbins. He’s a man wrongfully convicted of killing his wife and her lover. Once in prison, he’s the one who ordered a rock hammer through the black market run by Red, played by Morgan Freeman.\nHe’s also the one (spoiler alert!) who took years to tunnel - mere pocketfuls of ground down prison wall at a time - out of his cell to eventual freedom.\n\u0026quot;Get busy living or get busy dying\u0026quot; At a crucial point in the plot we hear the memorable, quotable words: “I guess it comes down to a simple choice, really. Get busy living or get busy dying_.”_ It’s only after we realize he’s escaped that Andy has been choosing to “get busy living” almost the entire time he’s been locked up in prison.\nWhen we see that Andy has been chiselling away at the tunnel hole in the wall of his cell for years see understand that he’s consistently chosen to not simply accept his present circumstances. Instead, despite the risk of being caught, Andy is doing what he can do to provide himself with hope for the future.\nWe all know it’s more comfortable not to take a risk. Instead we simply fit in, acquiesce to the loudest voice in the crowd, float along being defined by others. That’s a choice we make and it leads to a life in “prison.” Brooks Hatlen, a lifer, is an extreme example of this choice in the movie, and the message is clear: if you can’t leave your own mind-made prison, you might as well be dead.\nBrooks\u0026rsquo; end In the movie, the head guard Byron Hadley snarls out the reality of prison life to the new prisoners: “You eat when we say you eat, piss when we say you piss and shit when we say you shit.” A more elegant way of saying the same thing is, being stuck with others’ definitions of you, with the scripts that others write for you, the expectations that others define for you is a sure way to imprison yourself.\nAs Red explains, Brooks is an example of someone “institutionalized,” so used to the confines of prison life that he can’t function outside of it. It seems his hope was snuffed out long before we meet him. And after he’s released, Brooks can’t endure freedom and in the “fight or flight” urges produced in the lower brain stem, he decides for “flight” in the extreme by taking his own life.\nGravity - Different Movie, Same Message\u003e Gravity - Different Movie, Same Message # “Get busy living or get busy dying”. Dr. Ryan Stone, played by Sandra Bullock in the movie Gravity is faced with this same decision. Life can be shitty and just how will you decide to react to that? You can decide to give up and just take it, or you can get up the courage to work your way through it somehow. It\u0026rsquo;s the same call to action, just stated differently and in a completely different context, this time in space in low earth orbit.\nIn Gravity, released in 2013, after the International Space Station has been wiped out by the orbiting debris of a destroyed satellite, both Ryan and veteran astronaut Matt Kowalski, played by George Clooney, are left to survive in space. Circumstances force Kowalski to cut the tether between them so that Ryan can survive. He drifts helplessly into the void of space, and because of this courageous act, Ryan - eventually - makes her way to a Russian Soyuz module and is able to get safely inside.\nShe’s now safe in a womb-like space capsule but finds that its thrusters are completely out of fuel. She’s adrift. All the frantic scrambling she has gone through with Kowalski and his sacrifice of his life for hers has still come to nothing. She faces a slow, cold and lonely death.\nAfter repeated attempts to contact Mission Control, Ryan manages to connect with Aningaaq a man back on earth who happens to be using a ham radio. There is a touching back and forth between the two, but seemingly resigned to her fate, Ryan simply turns the dials in the spacecraft to decrease the oxygen supply to nothing in an attempt to speed her death.\nShe asks Aningaaq, now the only human contact she has, to sing her to sleep.\nDespite this, her subconscious has other plans. It has decided to “get busy living.”\nIn quick succession, we see Matt Kowalski thump on the Soyuz hatch window, open the hatch from the outside and swing himself into the spacecraft.\nWe see Kolwalski there, bantering about his new record time in space, finding the bottle of vodka he knows is stashed under a Soyuz seat and turning on the lights to brighten the mode of the place. But we know very well he can’t be real. This is Ryan’s mind rebelling against the decision to quit on life.\nAs the “two” converse, Ryan enumerates the reasons why she’s completely out of options, why there’s no hope. Kowalski interrupts the pattern of defeat:\nBut still, it’s a matter of what you do now. I get it, it’s nice up here. You can just shut down all the systems, turn out all the lights\u0026hellip; and just close your eyes and tune out everybody. There’s nobody up here that can hurt you. It’s safe. I mean, what’s the point of going on? What’s the point of living? Your kid died. Doesn’t get any rougher than that. But still, it’s a matter of what you do now. If you decide to go, then you gotta just get on with it. Sit back, enjoy the ride. You gotta plant both your feet on the ground and start livin’ life.\nThis is Ryan’s subconscious piping up: saying you have to “get busy living or get busy dying.”\nNo matter what you choice you make, you are always carrying through on some kind of action. You can choose a path that you believe will lead to growth and becoming or a path of inaction that seems safe yet ultimately leads to a “dead” life, a life of “Living and partly living” to borrow a phrase from the poet T.S. Elliot. These two movies have multiple themes but it seems to me this universal message they have in common is what makes them so satisfying to watch. That message is that in each moment of our lives we need to make choice between living - despite the pain, sometimes suffering that comes with it - and “death”, a passive life scripted by others.\n","date":"February 25, 2021","permalink":"/posts/the-endless-loop-of-decision/","section":"","summary":"Two very different stories share one identical, fundamentally important message.","title":"The Endless Loop of Decision"},{"content":"","date":"February 15, 2021","permalink":"/categories/japan/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Japan"},{"content":" A recent post introduced you to my ugly mug from Tobe. It has to be said though that having a coffee mug as a souvenir from Japan is more than little odd.\nIn Japan, tea rules. The everyday tea that people drink is green tea, generically called Ocha (お茶), and it is the fuel that drives the Japanese business world. So it makes far more sense that I’d have Japanese tea cups as souvenirs from Japan. And strange as I might seem, while in Japan I actually did the thing that makes sense. Whenever I got the chance to travel, I made a point of buying a tea cup at my various destinations. One place I had the good fortune to visit was Bizen in Okayama prefecture. During the time I worked in Hiroshima, the student of my teaching colleague drove us first to see Kōraku-en, a famous park in Okayama Prefecture. He then took us to meet some craftsmen who produced Bizen pottery.\nHere’s picture of the beautiful Bizen tea cup I bought.\nAs you can see, Bizen pottery is not your grandma’s china. Apparently, the clay in the area doesn’t lend itself to having glaze applied to it. Instead, Bizen pottery is fired at very high temperatures and one technique potters use is to throw charcoal into the kiln near the end of the 10-to-14 day firing period to act as partial glaze.\nSpeaking of the potter\u0026rsquo;s, here are a few pictures that were taken during our visit. I\u0026rsquo;m not completely sure that these are craftsmen who made the teacup above, but they were, master and apprentice in the middle of firing some pottery when we visited.\nGallery\u003e Gallery # The techniques used by Bizen potters results in a rough, imperfect and decidedly burnt-looking teacup. To our western eye it might look closer to a mistake, a reject.\nTo the Japanese eye the obvious “imperfections” of Bizen pottery can be seen as fundamentally beautiful.\nOnly recently, many years after leaving Japan, I think I’ve found out just why that is: it’s an appreciation of things that suggest imperfection because of that in turn suggests impermanence.\nIt’s part of the aesthetic that’s called wabi-sabi:\nMy understanding of wabi-sabi only is only Wikipedia-deep at this point, but here’s the best description of it I can find: The aesthetic [is] defined as the beauty of things \u0026ldquo;imperfect, impermanent, and incomplete\u0026rdquo;. Things in bud, or things in decay, as it were, are more evocative of wabi-sabi than things in full bloom because they suggest the transience of things. As things come and go, they show signs of their coming or going, and these signs are considered to be beautiful.\nWikipedia\nThis appreciation for the impermanence of things comes from the Buddhism where absolutely everything around us is considered to be “evolving from or dissolving into nothingness.”\nThis \u0026ldquo;nothingness\u0026rdquo; is not empty space. It is rather a space of potentiality. If the seas represent potential then each thing is like a wave arising from it and returning to it. There are no permanent waves. At no point is a wave complete, even at its peak. Nature is seen as a dynamic whole that is to be admired and appreciated.\nWikipedia\nI don’t know about you, but this makes complete sense to me. We are born made of the stuff of this earth and we’ll eventually return to again be the stuff of this earth. Our existence is like a wave welling up, travelling for distance, and returning to the ocean from which it came.\nIf tea cup you use reminds you of the nature of existence, that things are impermanent, perhaps constant reminders might change your view of life? Perhaps you might remember there’s a end to things and your time on earth is brief?\nPerhaps you might savour the tea you’re drinking in this moment just a little more?\n","date":"February 15, 2021","permalink":"/posts/my-beautiful-teacup-from-bizen/","section":"","summary":"I had the rare opportunity to visit with two potters who made Bizen pottery in Okayama Prefecture in Japan.

These days it’s not my first or even second choice when it comes to choosing a coffee mug in the morning.\nBut the mug I painted up with glaze to be fired as a souvenir from Tobe, Japan still tells me an important truth when I free it from the darkness of the cupboard. Here’s my mug from Tobe. My Ugly Mug from Tobe You calling it ugly? That’s okay, I can’t disagree very strongly. Marin Burch, the principal of the English conversation school in Matsuyama Ehime where I’d just started working in the fall of 1985, drove a group of us to nearby Tobe to try out painting glaze on plain, blank, unfired pottery mugs.\nWhy Tobe? Because it’s a town that has been famous for a style of blue and white pottery, called sometsuke, since the 1700’s. Our group of budding artists consisted of Aya, Marin’s teenage daughter, Kirsten from Tacoma, WA, another teacher already working at the school, and me, the “new guy” from Canada.\nWhen the time came to paint glaze on the blank mug, I distinctly remember a moment of panic. “What? Me an artist?” I searched my brain for any similar past experience to build on. Nothing. The brain was a blank as the mug I was holding up to paint.\nI vaguely remember there being pictures hanging about the pottery studio and I chose one to copy: a Chinese-style ink brush painting of misty mountains towering up over a lone boat on a meandering river. That’s what the squiggles you see on that mug are trying to be.\nBut the urge I remember most vividly from that painting session is that I felt I had fill up all the space. Leave no blank spot untouched! It was a kind of “I paid for the whole mug, so I have to paint on all of it” urge.\nNow fast forward to almost two years after that painting session. My teaching contract finished, I was packing up to leave Japan to return to Canada. Of course the souvenir mug I painted in Tobe was returning home with me.\nIt was only then I had an intense realization. After two years of living in Japan, if I were to sit down and paint the same mug, I would have painted it with an entirely different aim. The urge would not have been to fill the space up, but leave as much open space as possible. An artistic sense of appreciating negative space had quietly infiltrated my brain by some invisible cultural osmosis. After two years in Japan, the ink brush painting below is the kind of thing I would have wanted to imitate.\nA group of panels with obvious negative space. Hasegawa Tōhaku, Public domain, via Wikimedia Commons Of course my lack of artistic skill wouldn’t have rendered anything close to this, but the point is my idea of beauty had changed after having been immersed in the Japanese culture.\nIt’s not like I was focusing on any “artistic” theories during that time. Far from it: I was just living day-by-day, teaching English conversation, and when I was able, taking trips to a few places around Japan like Kyoto, Kyushu and Tokyo to name a few destinations. There was no conscious study of aesthetics whatsoever.\nBut living immersed in the Japanese culture had altered my brain. And it had altered by brain silently, with no warning. It was that invisible re-wiring of my brain that came as a complete surprise.\nIn contrast, it was easy to see my behaviour had been altered in day-to-day life. When living in a foreign culture it’s “do as the Romans do”: one molds oneself to fit in with the “flow” of the culture. One obvious example is the language of personal interactions that becomes become part the daily routine. For example, one wouldn’t dream of asking someone to do something without adding an ”おねがいします” （onegaishimasu - translated “Please do it for me” or simply “Please”). Months after returning to Canada, I was still muttering this phrase under my breath while asking for a favour from someone. In Japan, I couldn’t finish a class and return to the office without someone bestowing a “おつかりさまでした！” on me as I entered the room. “Otsukarisama deshita” translates variously as “Good job!”, “You must be tired”, “You worked hard!” These common expressions serve a cultural “grease” that make for smoother group interactions. It was obvious to me they were changing my behaviour because they were being repeated every day. But during my every day interactions with others no one was attempting to influence my personal aesthetic, my touchstone for deciding what was and what wasn’t artistically beautiful. No one once mentioned “negative space” during my time in Japan. That aesthetic simply surrounded me without me even noticing.\nThe saying “Fish discover water last” comes to mind. My version has always been “A fish is the last creature I’d ask for a definition of water”. To a fish, water just is. How do you notice, much less question, what simply is?\nMy ugly mug reminds me that I once swam in a pond that contained a different kind of water. And it changed me.\n","date":"February 10, 2021","permalink":"/posts/my-ugly-mug-from-tobe/","section":"","summary":"I still have my \u0026ldquo;ugly mug\u0026rdquo; from Tobe, Ehime Prefecture, Japan.

Learning’s just not my thing!” You won’t because humans simply like to learn new things. It’s in our nature.\nThat said, I think you’ll agree that there are differences in the effort different people put into constantly learning new things. Doing that isn’t easy. Constant learning means challenging the mind-constructed comfort zone of one’s current world view. It means taking a risk to learn, test and absorb new ideas that ultimately change that worldview. And while all that is happening one is very likely to feel a bit lost, a uncertain and maybe a bit stupid. All that can can be uncomfortable, scary even.\nAnd if you’re really serious about making a habit of learning new things, I think you’ll agree that you’ll want to be just as serious about doing whatever you can to first, retain that learning and second use it to change how you think, do and act in the future.\nIn the recent past when reading a book to learn from - as opposed to pure pleasure-reading - I thought I was doing all I could to retain the ideas I’d gleaned.\nFor example, I knew I’d learn best if I was actively engaged with what I was reading. That usually meant having a pen in my hand - or a highlighter - to mark passages that seemed to most important. Comments or questions would be also be scribbled in the margin.\nSound familiar?\nActive reading means having your pen ready to scribble and interact with the text. Underlining and making marginal notes is a good habit, but it only goes so far if you want any learning you\u0026rsquo;ve done to last\nIn my opinion this method of interacting with the material should be second nature. If it’s not, I would whole-heartedly suggest you get a pen in your hand while you read a book or learn from any other content source like a blog post, movie, podcast, and so on. To be honest, even though I’d done that work, I found myself opening up a book I’d read a few months before to see the text marked with underlines, and the margins dabbled with scribbles, and any learning I’d done back then was pretty well completely forgotten.\nWhat was the point of all that, if I was just going to forget it all anyway?\nThe Promise of a Better Way\u003e The Promise of a Better Way # Before you continue to underline text and scribble in the margins, consider another way of engaging with the content you’re reading. It’s a method that’s gotten quite a lot of buzz during the past few years and I’ve just started to wrap my brain around it recently. I’m not going to say the method promises an easier way of learning and remembering, but I honestly believe it has the potential to be a much more effective on both counts.\nIt’s called the Zettelkasten method. I know what you might be thinking: that I’m going to tell you it was invented by someone named Baron von Zettelkasten in the late 1800’s in Bavaria. But no, there are no over-sized moustaches and faded portraits of spikey-helmeted German barons involved here.\nA Zettelkasten or \u0026quot;Slip-box\u0026quot; It’s a lot more basic than all that. Zettel is simply German for “note” and kasten translates as “box”. Literally, “Note-box”. Zettelkasten is generally translated as “slip-box.” Frankly, this is not a word I remember ever using in English. I would more likely call a “slip-box” a small version of a card catalogue, you know the kind you used to see taking up most of the first floor of any library in the “olden days” before computers.\nBut what does a “slip-box” have to do with a different way of learning?\nFirst, let’s go back to the underlined text in the books you’ve read. That underlined text and the scribbles in the margin are all that remain from the time you decided which passages were the most important in the book. When you made those marks in the book you were engaged with the ideas it was describing. But that time has passed.\nWhen you close the book the learning experience gradually washes away from your memory. Be honest, despite your hard work and maybe an A on an exam, that’s what happened. This is simply the way things are if you rely solely on this technique of learning.\nSure, you can can go back to the book and now it’s easier to zero in on what you seemed to think was important. But close that book and in a couple of sleeps, poof, it’s all gone again. It’s like some perpetual, evil magic trick.\nHow to Take Smart Notes, by Sönke Ahrens Sönke Ahrens, the author of How to Take Smart Notes points out this problem: merely underlining sections of text and writing the odd comment in the margin will very soon become useless to you. He has alternative method. It may not be easier, but in his opinion - and mine, I’ve decided - it many times better.\nAhrens says that instead of merely underlining text, you have to do something with important ideas you’ve gleaned from the book and the Zettelkasten method tells you exactly what to do.\nFirst you should have a pen in your hand and make what he calls “Literature Notes”. Since his book is primarily aimed at an academic audience, the word “Literature” means the collection of research amassed on a certain subject. I prefer calling these “Raw Notes”.\nNotice I didn’t say that you “take” notes; no, you’re expected to make the notes, that is, reword or translate the ideas you learn into your own words as you make notes on the content. This forces you to interact with the material, question your understanding of it, and look for ways to fill any gaps in that understanding as you go. Now you’re both engaged and thinking about the content.\nEventually, you will be archiving these “Literature Notes” so it’s important that you’ve captured as much as you can from your source, be it a book, an article, blog post, or YouTube video, and so on.\nEither while you’re taking these “Literature Notes” or soon after you’ve finished, you then make “Permanent Notes”. These are the notes that Niklas Luhman, the original developer of the Zettelkasten method, would add to his slip-box on what we would call index cards.\nTattered index cards Examples of Luhman\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;Permanent Notes\u0026rdquo;. These would find a permanent home in his Zettelkasten (Slip-box\nPermanent notes have some unique qualities. They are “atomic” in that they describe, as briefly as possible, a fundamental, core idea or concept. They are written in full-sentences so that it stands on its own, meaning the note should be able to be understood by you or anyone else outside of the context from which you just extracted the idea.\nPut another way, you write this note for an audience of one: your future self, who will inevitably forget the concept and having ever written the note in the first place.\nAlready the demands of this method are “forcing” you to think, grapple, and question with ideas and concepts in two different passes, first when creating “Literature” notes and second, when creating “Permanent” notes. Compare this to simply underlining words in a book. I think you’ll agree that while this method is more demanding, it will certainly lead to a greater understanding of whatever it is you’re trying to learn.\nThat said, the real power of the system comes with the next step: saving your Permanent Notes in slip-box system and linking those ideas to others already there. When Luhman undertook this step, he used a system of numbers to identify each and every new note he added to the system. It allowed for chains of related ideas to form and because the notes were “self-contained” it also allowed for ideas to be connected to other notes no matter where they were stored in his slip-box. But, yikes, that sounds like a lot of tedious work, doesn’t it?\nSoftware Makes the Zettelkasten Method Far Easier\u003e Software Makes the Zettelkasten Method Far Easier # These days the idea of “hyperlink” from one document to another is second nature to us and linking notes together is extremely easy with the right software.\nWeb-based Roam Research has produced a lot of praise for its ability to store and link notes, but it comes with no free option and at what I personally consider too steep a subscription price at $US 15/ month or $US 165/ year. It is housed entirely online and so there’s always a nagging question about the status of the content you create with the software.\nThe relatively new Obsidian, a free, open-source option, offers similar features, but runs locally in a stand alone application on your computer. It also stores files locally so you always know exactly where your work is. There are many options for safeguarding your work and storing inside a file sharing and syncing service like Dropbox, iCloud, or OneDrive are popular choices. I happen to have simple Network Attached Storage device so my \u0026ldquo;vault\u0026rdquo; of notes is kept there and accessible from any computer in the house.\nLike Roam, Obsidian uses Markdown exclusively so you can add formatting to your text similar to HTML (bold, italic, bullet points, etc), images and other HTML tags if needed. Since Markdown has become a standard import / export format for many applications, and files are stored in text format, your work is extremely portable and future-proofed. Learn more about Markdown if it\u0026rsquo;s new to you.\nThere are other promising applications like Remnote, Tiddlywiki, Stroll, and org-roam which I’ve only poked at in passing.\nObsidian with the \u0026quot;Graph view\u0026quot; displayed. Each \u0026quot;dot\u0026quot; on the graph represents a note and the lines between notes represents a link them. I’ve personally decided to climb the Obsidian learning curve and I’ll use it to save and link any notes created while reading (books, blog posts), listening (podcasts) or watching (YouTube, Vimeo). Obsidian’s features are impressive even though it’s still relatively early days in its development: at this writing, it hasn’t yet reached the version 1 status yet.\nAt this point, I’m still a Zettelkasten newbie. I’ve got the theory down but I honestly don’t yet have much experience actually working to create, link and think through a significant number of linked notes.\nI’ll be sure to add new posts in the future describing my software of choice Obsidian and my experience working with it in the future.\n","date":"February 1, 2021","permalink":"/posts/zettelkasten-the-promise-of-a-truly-effective-method-of-learning/","section":"","summary":"A brief introduction to the Zettelkasten method of note making as described in How to Take Smart Notes by Sönke Ahrens.","title":"Zettelkasten: the Promise of A Truly Effective Method of Learning"},{"content":"","date":"August 24, 2020","permalink":"/categories/cool-apps/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Cool Apps"},{"content":"","date":"August 24, 2020","permalink":"/categories/mapping/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Mapping"},{"content":" Welcome to Part 3 of the StoryMapJS Tutorial\u003e Welcome to Part 3 of the StoryMapJS Tutorial # StoryMapJS is free online software that lets you tell a story with media — including images, video or audio - and augment that story by displaying specific locations on a map. It’s one of many projects developed, hosted and freely shared by Knight Lab, part of Northwestern University.\nIn Part 1, I introduced StoryMapJS.\nIn Part 2, I covered the process of building StoryMap slides.\nIn this third and final part of the StoryMapJS tutorial, I’ll cover\nUnderstanding the Publish Changes Button Adding your Your Map Markers Configuring How Your StoryMap is Displayed Sharing Your StoryMap Understanding the Publish Changes Button\u003e Understanding the Publish Changes Button # StoryMapJS saves your work to two separate versions of your StoryMap: the Draft version (named “draft.html” if you link to it) and the “Final” version (named “index.html”). In Part 1 of the tutorial we covered the “Save” button. This saves your most recent changes to the Draft version. Those changes are saved to the “Final” version only when you click the “Publish Changes” button. This way you can work on making changes to the StoryMap in the background and not publish those changes until you’re sure you want to.\nAdding Your Own Map Markers\u003e Adding Your Own Map Markers # The temple icon By default, the markers on the map reflect the kind of media you’ve added: an image will have a certain icon, a YouTube video another.\nThe “Marker Options” button lets you add your own marker images to the map which will display instead of the default markers you see.\nSince my StoryMap is about Buddhist temples, it might be a nice touch to add map marker icons that remind one of a temple.\nI can upload this icon to the StoryMapJS site and it will display instead of the default markers.\nEach slide icon is independent of other slides so you could upload icons that represent the location such as a store, or airport or museum, etc.\nOptions Dialog Box\u003e Options Dialog Box # The options button The Options dialog box contains a number of important settings that affect how your StoryMap is displayed. Open the dialog box by clicking the Options button at the top left.\nOptions Dialog Box StoryMap Size\u003e StoryMap Size # These numbers determine the size of an embedded StoryMap. My recommendation is always keep the width at 100%. You may need to alter the Height once your StoryMap is embedded on your webpage, depending on the space available on the page and the amount of content on your slides.\nLanguage\u003e Language # This setting changes the navigation buttons and messages in your StoryMap to the the selected language.\nFonts\u003e Fonts # StoryMapJS offers a number of font combinations for your headline and text. Take the time to try a few of the combinations because they can enhance the aesthetic of your StoryMap substantially.\nTreat as Cartography or Image\u003e Treat as Cartography or Image # The primary difference between these too settings is the that lines are drawn between map location markers when “Treat as Cartography” is selected. Those lines do not appear when “Treat as Image” is selected.\nTreat as Cartography Call to Action\u003e Call to Action # If you choose “Yes”, a button appears on the title screen of your StoryMap under the headline and text you’ve added. The button is meant to prompt the visitor to continue to the next slide.\nThe default text of the button reads “Start Exploring”, but you can change that in the text field here. As an example, I’ve changed the text to “Start Exploring The Temples.”\nStart Exploring Button Map Type\u003e Map Type # StoryMapJS allows you to change the basemap that displays on the left side of the screen. You may want to change the baseman depending on the aesthetic you want your map to present.\nBuilt-in map typesStamen maps are generally present a low detail, subdued look. Open Street Maps offer an accurate, highly-detailed map.MapboxMapbox is a mapping service that is completely separate from StoryMapJS. Mapbox offers both free and paid accounts and with the free account, your maps are allowed a generous allotment of up to 25,000 views / month. Mapbox has a number of built-in styles including “Streets”, “Light”, “Dark”, “Outdoors”, and “Satellite”. Check out various styles on the sample map here. You’ll need to do a little research on how to best use Mapbox, including creating an account to obtain an “Access Token” in order to access your maps.Gigapixel mapsGigapixel maps allow you to use a large image as your map instead of the usual map of the earth. For example, the “Game of Thrones: Arya’s Journey” map example on the site uses an image of Westeros from the Game of Thrones as the basemap. You’ll need special software to break any large image into map tiles, allowing your visitor it zoom in certain parts of the map. To learn more about the software and the concept, check out this page o the StoryMapJS site to learn more about gigapixel maps.Custom maps\u0026nbsp; If you are using custom maps, the assumption is you are hosting your map and all the tiles that make up the zoom levels of your map, on your own web server. Sharing Your StoryMap\u003e Sharing Your StoryMap # The share button lets you share your StoryMap with others. Let’s go through the options it offers you.\nShare Dialog Box Share Link\u003e Share Link # The share link is a simple URL which, when accessed, will open your StoryMap in a web browser window.\nNote that if you paste a link into a post on Medium.com, the service will automatically render the link into an embedded version of the StoryMap (more on embedding below).\nSocial Media Shares\u003e Social Media Shares # StoryMapJS also provides links to a few social media services like Twitter, Facebook, and reddit.\nYou can add a brief description and provide a “Featured Image” to enhance your post on Facebook or Twitter.\nFor example, if you provide a featured image, your post would look like this on Facebook.\nFacebook with Image added to Post If you don’t supply a featured image, an image of the Knight lab logo is attached instead.\nA Facebook post with no image Embedding Your StoryMap on a Webpage or Blog Post\u003e Embedding Your StoryMap on a Webpage or Blog Post # Embedding your StoryMap on a webpage or blog post displays it on the page itself by using the HTML “iframe” tag. The advantage of embedding your StoryMap on your web page or blog post is your visitors don’t leave your site in order to experience the cool content you’ve created.\nShare Dialog - Embed Code For example, here are the steps to embed your StoryMap in a WordPress post.\nCopy the embed code from the Share dialog box. Assuming you’re using WordPress’s newer Gutenberg editor, you’ll want to use the “Custom HTML” block. Paste the embed code into the “Custom HTML” block, save the post as a draft (or publish it) and view the post. Note: If you’re using WordPress’s “Classic” editor, you’ll need to paste the code into the “Text” tab which displays your post along with any HTML markup that has been applied to it.\nThat wraps it up for Part 3 of the StoryMapJS tutorial and for the entire series.\nIf you missed them, check out Part 1 where I introduce StoryMapJS and Part 2 where I go through the process of how to build StoryMap slides.

The title says it’s about a meal and yes the post, eventually and briefly describes an actual meal.\nBut the real topic is adapting to new and different realities. I’d been forced to adapt to a new “minimalist” reality when I first arrived in Cambridge Bay. Then I was introduced to someone else’s reality which I found to be SO much better, when it comes to quality of food anyway.\nFirst, a preamble to set the context. I feel I need to explain why I went out of my way to create a page on the website to talk about the experience of eating just one meal.\nI arrived in Cambridge Bay on August 25, 1997 and the story of the meal took place on September 9. The days surrounding THE MEAL were filled with activity. All College instructors completed a two-week Certificate in Adult Education course during my first two weeks in town. The days were busy. The after hours were filled with trying to settle in to a new job, learn about new responsibilities, new people, and a new environment.\nThis time was also a new experience for me in that I was \u0026ldquo;roughing it.\u0026rdquo; Now \u0026ldquo;roughing it\u0026rdquo; is really a relative idea. For some it is living on the land, sleeping close to the earth, with the barest of essentials. To me, it meant living with whatever I brought on the plane the day I arrived. Granted in my case that was five big bags full of clothes, toothpaste, a cup, etc. People here have shared some really important tools for getting through a day like toilet paper, a kettle, a pan, and more recently, even a T.V. and a radio. What’s more, I had a very nice roof over my head, a $989 furnished apartment. So I had somewhere to sleep and sit, even if my stomach was relatively empty for a while. I say \u0026ldquo;relatively\u0026rdquo; because it really wasn’t ever empty; it just wasn’t as full with the same amount of food as usual.\nLiving in a minimalist way was something I’ve always conceived of, but have never been in the situation where I had to do it. This was a very interesting time for me. This is where the conception of being minimalist and the reality of really having to experience some of it met. I tend to spend a lot of my time in my mind. This is a strength and, yes, a weakness too.\nBut here was a real life situation. I have often thought about the idea of living in an isolated place where the only thing to do was learn and study and get closer to knowing things. In Japan I wondered how I would REALLY react if I lived in a Zen temple for a year. You know, that austere lifestyle of getting up at 4 am, washing your face in a basin of cold water before you starting sweeping a dirt path with a straw broom.\nWhere would my mind go? Would it crave the stimulation of flashing pictures on a screen or would it mellow into a state of serene knowing of the greater oneness flowing through all things? Was I now living in a situation that would allow me to test this for myself? No, not really. But at least I had a touch of this concept, living with a fork, a knife, a spoon, a cup, a kettle and some oatmeal (quick cooking, of course).\nIt was a memorable time. When you don’t have much, everything you do have and lay your hands on tends to mean something. For example, when you get a new luxury like a second empty plastic container of milk to store water, or a radio after two weeks without any electronic devices in the house. When those things enter your experience after so long of an absence, it makes a huge impression on you.\nWhat is it like to actually LIVE in these “minimalist” circumstances for an extended period of time? I had one living example in my past.\nFlashback Tangent:\u003e Flashback Tangent: # When I worked in Germany for a couple of months during the summer of 1982, I spent a lot of time with a wonderful woman named Frau Lotte. At that time, she was about 65-70 years old, I would guess. She was Polish and had lived through the Second World War. Frau Lotte saved EVERYTHING. Nothing went into the garbage unless it was totally and absolutely spent, finished, kaput! I know the experience of war and scarcity influenced a whole generation across the world, but unless one gets a taste of scarcity, it doesn’t mean anything to someone like me who was born into a time of prosperity.\nThe Meal\u003e The Meal # This meal made a huge impression on me. First, let’s get it straight. It was only pork chops, carrots and rice. That is the hard, cold reality. Someone reading this who has three squares a day might think this was some feast of delicacies sprinkled with caviar. No it wasn’t. But it had been SO long since I’d experienced a decent home cooked meal. The experience of sitting down and eating a well cooked meal was dim in the reaches of my memory.\nHere’s the scene. I was invited by Suz B. to have dinner with her and her roommate Danielle M. Of course, I refused at first. I didn’t want to put them out. But the concept of an actual meal intrigued me. What was it? It was something I hadn’t experienced for quite a while. I didn’t bother refusing three times just to be polite. I said \u0026ldquo;Yes\u0026rdquo;!\n\u0026ldquo;You have to bring the vegetable,\u0026rdquo; I was told. This was a no brainer. I had carrots in the fridge, you know, the little miniature formed carrots that just don’t look natural anywhere but a veggie and dip tray. These things are as big a mystery to me as how they get the caramilk in the Cadbury Caramilk bar. Some things are must meant to remain unknown, mysterious, and strange.\nAn hour later, I carried my meagre contribution of carrots and apples across the street. Soon I was to see just HOW meagre my contribution really was. After a bit of chit-chat, Suz asked Danielle if this was a special occasion. I told them it was for me. This was a MEAL after all. It was special, they agreed, because I was their first visitor for a meal. That was enough of an excuse to \u0026hellip;..have a glass of \u0026hellip;..WINE. Yes wine, people. It was red and dry and even though I prefer wine white and little sweeter, that one glass of wine was like the nectar of the Gods.\nDespite the big build up, I won’t give a play-by-play, bite-by-bite, MMM-by-MMM, of the meal itself. It tasted excellent. And what made it even more excellent was the awe I felt, the thankfulness for such a relatively simple thing. I say \u0026ldquo;simple\u0026rdquo; because I didn’t have to cook it. But I got a glimpse of how much I take for granted in life. Just that glimpse was enough to try to get the message across to you.\n(The ending to this story turned into a bit of a Wonder Years clone: try reading this last paragraph with a young Fred Savage face in your mind and the narrator of the show in your brain. — Hmm, that “Wonder Years” reference might be completely lost on most readers. It was a TV show. There was always a narrated voiceover by the lead character as he looked back on his childhood experiences that had played out in the episode).\n","date":"August 19, 2020","permalink":"/posts/the-meal/","section":"","summary":"The title suggests this post is about a meal, but the topic is really about adapting to new and different realities.","title":"The Meal"},{"content":" StoryMapJS is free online software that lets you tell a story with media — including images, video or audio - and augment that story by displaying specific locations on a map. It’s one of many projects developed, hosted and freely shared by Knight Lab, part of Northwestern University. Check it out here at the Knight Lab site.\nThis is Part 2 of a three-part tutorial on StoryMapJS. In Part 1, I introduced StoryMapJS, reviewed a couple of StoryMap examples and briefly covered the authoring tool. Here we’ll focus on how to build a StoryMap and in Part 3 I’ll cover how to share a StoryMap. First you’ll need to log in to StoryMapJS and that is covered in Part 1: click here to review.\nThe StoryMapJS Authoring Tool\u003e The StoryMapJS Authoring Tool # After logging in, the first screen you see is the StoryMapJS authoring tool ready for you to add content to the StoryMap’s title slide. Here’s a brief overview of the sections of screen.\nThe parts of the authoring tool. Map Location This is where you set the location on the map. In your completed StoryMap, the title slide displays all the locations of the slides in your StoryMap. So you don’t specify a location on this particular slide. Slide Icon Column The left hand column displays the icons for the title slide, shown in red here, and the slides you add to your StoryMap. This let’s you select a certain slide to edit as you’re building your StoryMap. Add Media You can upload images or provide links to images, video streaming services (YouTube, Vimeo and Dailymotion are supported), and many other services such as Wikipedia, SoundCloud and DocumentCloud. The media you add here displays on the right side of the screen above any headline or text you add. Add Headline or Text You’ll want to add a headline (or think of it as a title for the screen) and some descriptive text to your slide. The editor has bold, italic and hyperlink buttons. It also includes an “Edit Code” button so you can view the content with any HTML tags. Background Color or Image You can add a background color or image to the right side of the slides. In my experience, adding a background color makes any text you’ve added more difficult to read. My recommendation is to either avoid adding a solid color or add background image instead. When you add a background image, the opacity is automatically changed so that text is easy to read. Adding Media to Your Title Slide\u003e Adding Media to Your Title Slide # To add media to your slides — in most cases, images being the one exception — you add links to media that already exists somewhere else on the web.\nRetrieve the URL ( that is, the link to that media) and paste it in the “URL to your media” field at the top of the Media section.\nAdd Headline and Text\u003e Add Headline and Text # For example, the URL of the tutorial video hosted on YouTube that accompanies this post is \u0026quot;https://youtu.be/Uagc-s\\_yA9c\u0026quot;.\nTo add that video to the slide you would simply copy and paste that URL into the field. It will take StoryMapJS a couple of seconds to connect and then you’ll see a thumbnail of the video appear. Vimeo and Dailymotion videos are supported in the same way.\nAdd Media with Thumbnail Add Media with Thumbnail\u003e Add Media with Thumbnail # Follow this same process to add many other kinds of media to your your slide.\nImagesPaste in the link to image. Note that the default share link from Flickr doesn’t work. You need to extract the images address from the the Flickr embed code instead. Look for the link beginning with “live.staticflickr.com”.Wikipedia PagesPaste the page address.Tweets from TwitterPaste the share link from the tweet.Audio hosted at SoundCloudPaste the share link from the audio.Services like Dropbox or Google Photos don't workIn my experience pasting links to images hosted on a service like Dropbox or Google Photos will not work. If there are methods to makes these services work, I’d be happy to learn about them, so please comment below. Uploading Images\u003e Uploading Images # As mentioned, adding images are an exception to the adding of links to media because you have the option of uploading images directly to the StoryMapJS site. This may be your only option if you don’t have an option to store your images elsewhere on the web.\nThe process of uploading images is simple:\nClick the “Upload an Image” button, Search for the image on your computer, Click Open and The image will be uploaded and resized on the StoryMapJS site. Finally, remember to give credit where credit is due. Provide an attribution to the owner of the image if the image is not yours. Adding a Headline and Text to Your Title Slide\u003e Adding a Headline and Text to Your Title Slide # Add Headline and Text This section allows you add a “Headline” (or title if you want to think of it that way) and text to your slide.\nText Editor Buttons In the text editor you see four buttons.\nThe bold and italic buttons are straightforward enough. Click the “Edit HTML” button to change the editor to “HTML mode” where you can see any HTML tags in the content. A blue glow appears around the field when it’s in “Edit HTML” mode. Finally, the link button allows you to add web links to content in the editor. Select some text, then clink the link button, supply the URL in the pop-up dialog box, check the “Open link in new window” box and click “Insert Link”. Adding a Location to a Slide\u003e Adding a Location to a Slide # You add new slide by clicking the Add Slide Button in the left column.\nAdd Slide Button The only change you’ll see from the title slide is you now have a search field to find locations on the map. You can search for a location like a city or an address. Once you have located the place you’re looking for, you can zoom in on the map using the “+” button in the upper left and then click, hold and drag the map marker to wherever you want on the map. Since I tend to travel to places that don’t have addresses, I often use GPS coordinates instead.\nEntering GPS Coordinates on the Map\u003e Entering GPS Coordinates on the Map # To create a map marker using GPS coordinates, first you’ll need the coordinates in Decimal Degrees format, meaning the degrees and minutes need to look like this: DDD.MMMMM.\nWhere to find GPS coordinates with Bing Maps You can easily get GPS coordinates from online mapping services like Google Maps or Bing Maps. For example, on Bing Maps, simply right click the location on the map and copy the coordinates at the bottom of the context menu.\nIn Google Maps, it’s a tiny bit more manual: left click a location on the map. A information dialog box should appear at the bottom of the screen. Select the GPS coordinates and copy them.\nWhere to find GPS coordinates with Google Maps Finding Coordinates with the StoryMapJS Search Field\u003e Finding Coordinates with the StoryMapJS Search Field # Here’s the process for making StoryMap recognize your GPS coordinates:\nPaste the GPS coordinates in the “Search for a location” field at the bottom of the StoryMap map section. Remove any punctuation between the two numbers. Add “lat:” (without the quotation marks) in front of the latitude and “lon:” in front of the longitude, like this:\nStoryMap Coords When you’ve done that, the map should recognize the coordinates and automatically create a marker at those coordinates. You can then reposition the marker manually by clicking and dragging it with your mouse.\nAdding a Background Image (or Color) to a Slide\u003e Adding a Background Image (or Color) to a Slide # You can add a background color or a background image to the right side of the screen.\nTo see the “Slide Background” dialog box, click the “Background Options” button at the lower right.\nBackground Options Add a Background Color\u003e Add a Background Color # To add a background color, click inside of the “Background Color” field and a color picker appears. The field only accepts color hex values but the color picker lets you find the hex value if you drag the picker and use the coloured column at the right to chose the color you want.\nAdd a Background Color In my experience, adding a background color tends to make any text you have on the screen less readable. I suggest to you check this out yourself.\nAdd a Background Image\u003e Add a Background Image # You can add a background image by pasting the URL of an image hosted on the web into the “Background Image” field or by uploading an image. Other images you have uploaded to this StoryMap are available by clicking the down arrow at the left.\nThe opacity of background images is automatically altered so that text is easy to read, even with a somewhat busy image in the background.\nWhat to learn more?

That\u0026rsquo;s some 22 years after the actual incident so there is a distinct lack of detail and large helping of \u0026ldquo;Maybe it was like this or that, don\u0026rsquo;t quite remember\u0026rdquo;. Despite all that, I did want to tell the story because the whole experience was, just as the title says, anticlimactic.\nLate during my stay in Cambridge Bay, I was part of what turned out to be a memorably odd chartered ice-fishing trip. My memory is very hazy about most of the particulars of the trip, including about exactly when it took place, but it certainly during the spring of 1998. Ice-fishing in spring? You might be thinking that sounds less than safe. But in the arctic spring doesn’t mean a massive melt; it just means more light, almost 24 hours of it for a while. Yes it\u0026rsquo;s the beginning of a long slow melt that may finish sometime in late July or early August. But in the months of spring everything that was ridiculously cold and frozen during the winter is now just merely really frozen.\nThis ice-fishing excursion involved a large group of people piling onto a chartered plane with the aim of flying out of town, landing on a frozen lake, and augering some ice-fishing holes to do some fishing.\nNow, I don’t think I’ve ever ice-fished in my life and apologies to all you ice-fishing fans, the thought of it has me ranking it just above watching paint dry.\nSo for me it couldn’t have been the lure of ice-fishing that got me on that plane. No, I’m 100% sure the draw was the chance of being part of an excursion out of town - by plane or by any other means possible. Obviously many others felt the same. I’d say there were about 25 people all told.\nI can’t quite remember if we paid for the excursion or if it was a free promotional thing for the airline charter company. Now that I think of it, maybe the bunch of us were just oblivious ballast for the pilots to get some practice ski landings in on a frozen arctic lake.\nIn any case, we took off and someone must have had an idea where to go because we flew for a while before descending to land on a frozen lake. We made a number of passes at the landing spot, I’m thinking three or more. Having seen TV shows about bush piloting since then, I know now that it’s quite normal to scout out the landing spot first and even attempt and abort landings in arctic conditions. But at that time, having only flown on commercial flights in the south where there are paved runways, the multiple attempts thing wasn’t part of my experience. I distinctly remember my stress level increasing at each attempt. But what can you do? You’re a captive sardine who is still euphoric from having the opportunity to escape the confines of town for a few hours.\nWe landed (finally) on a frozen lake and people piled out of the plane. Okay, now what? But we landed safely and piled out of the plane. I remember the gender roles kicking in without anyone saying anything: a tent was set up quickly and the women-folk started on making food, including the heating up the chilli that someone had made.\nThe ice auger The men-folk, a couple of them schlepping an ice auger, made their way out a bit onto a spot on the ice to drill holes to begin ice-fishing. I was part of that group.\nAnd one-by-one the men-folk took turns yanking on the pull cord to get the ice auger motor started.\nAnd we yanked on the cord. And the motor did nothing.\nWe yanked on the cord, and the motor did nothing.\nWe yanked on the cord, and the motor\u0026hellip;\nWe yanked on the cord.\nWe yanked.\nWe\n…gave up, hauled the stupid thing back to the tent and everyone just ate chilli. And I remember it being really good.\nWe no doubt all agreed that we didn’t want fish anyway and besides ice-fishing is stupid and boring.\nThe tent That’s my very vague recollection of the group ice-fishing trip. It’s more than a little anti-climatic I know, but that’s the way reality goes sometimes. Not with a bang, but a whimper.\nTIm S. and I did take some time to walk a ways to do some hero shots of each other with the plane in the background.

A location is required for each slide. Then at least one of the next three elements is required, but you can include any combination of the three on the right side to the screen.\nSome kind of media such as an image, a video or even audio. A headline and some textual content which can include HTML and A background color or image to provide a nice aesthetic feel to the slide. So slides always require a map location on the left, and on the right side need to have at least one kind of media, but can have any variation of the other three elements.\nCreating a New StoryMap\u003e Creating a New StoryMap # Logging in to the StoryMapJS Authoring Tool\u003e Logging in to the StoryMapJS Authoring Tool # StoryMapJS uses your Google Account for authentication so naturally you’ll need a Google account to make use of the service.

Background Color or Text # You can add a background color or image to the right side of the slides. In my experience, adding a background color makes any text you’ve added more difficult to read. My recommendation is to either avoid adding a solid color or add background image instead. When you add a background image, the opacity is automatically changed so that text is easy to read.\nThis was just a quick introductory overview of StoryMapJS and its the authoring tool.

This was the name I preferred calling the place because it’s the option I had a fighting chance of pronouncing correctly.\nAnd speaking of pronouncing \u0026ldquo;Taloyoak\u0026rdquo;, I made a minor hobby of asking native inuktitut speakers how to pronounce it correctly. I was surprised at the range of responses I got. Students were at the college in Cambridge Bay from all over the north because some programs were only offered there. Their local dialects rendered this four-syllables worth of sounds - a couple of which English speakers just don\u0026rsquo;t make - slightly differently. This made me feel just a tiny bit better when this native English speaker butchered the pronunciation. Incidentally, Taloyoak is the northernmost community on the North American mainland. Remember that when you get hit with the question during your next trivia challenge.\nWhy make such a big deal about a trip to another town?\u003e Why make such a big deal about a trip to another town? # In the post Traveling to Cambridge Bay, I wrote about my initial trip to Cambridge Bay. It was a long day, and about as antiseptic as modern air travel can be. On the other hand it was trip in the new, the unknown. The day ushered me into a new reality: a small town north of the Arctic Circle.\nAnd I’ve been in Cambridge Bay ever since. I don’t mean I haven’t moved away from Cambridge. I don’t mean I haven’t gone because of the strong emotional ties to the land. I mean that was August 25, this is November and I have been in the town of Cambridge Bay for the entire time.\nI mean, like it or not, I’ve been here ever since because there is nowhere else to go.\nIf that statement seems rather final, and perhaps a little harsh, you have to remember that, although I come from a small town in Saskatchewan, in the past I was mobile. I could jump in a car any weekend and travel somewhere to bike, to ski or go shop in the city. I could change my surroundings with the simple act of pointing the car out of town and stepping on the gas pedal.\nCan’t do that here.\nWith the exception of couple of brief trips on an ATV, I have been in the confines of the town since I got here. It isn’t the cold that keeps me in, nor is it the lack of time or inclination to travel. It’s the vast expanse of The Land and the lack of good transportation to travel over it that keeps me here.\nI’ve been calling this confinement and its effects the fish bowl mentality. You can swim around and around and pretend you see life from different depths and angles and for a while exploring the fish bowl is fun. There are the pretty rocks on the bottom. There are other fish to meet and there is the routine of regular feedings. But after a while the novelty wears off of things like the fake diver standing beside the plastic chest blowing up the bubbles. It’s not that you don’t like it; it’s just that you want to get the chance of looking at something else, changing your perspective.\nOn Monday, November 17 I got the chance to change my perspective.\nThere Was a Job to Do\u003e There Was a Job to Do # Cambridge Bay is the main campus of the Kitikmeot Region of Nunavut Arctic College. There are five “sub-campuses”: Kugluktuk, Gjoa Haven, Holman, Pelly Bay and Taloyoak. Having worked for a Regional College in Saskatchewan, I am quite used to the idea of large distances between College offices. We used to think travelling an hour and a half to get to one of our offices was a big trip. But three hours in a plane to get to another office is something else again.\nHere’s why I was going. The six computers used in the small lab in Taloyoak needed new hard drives. Another fellow who works for the local Health Board was good enough to try to install the drives on a trip through town, but he had trouble with them and didn’t have the time in his schedule to spend musing on what the problem might be.\nThe job still had to be done, so I was asked to travel to Taloyoak on Monday, November 17. Once I got there, the next plane back out to Cambridge Bay would be Wednesday, November 19, so had about a day and half to do the job. Normally this would be plenty of time, but I was a bit apprehensive because of the former troubles getting the job done. I parked all the tools and software I could. I made boot disks, and tested the procedure on a test computer before going. I thought I was ready, but I the computer fix-it business, who ever really knows what’s going to come up. In fact, I coined a phrase during this job that I’ll probably use for the rest of my life. When it comes to dealing with these beasts: \u0026ldquo;No promises; no predictions.\u0026rdquo;\nLeaving Town\u003e Leaving Town # On the way out of town I picked up a care package requested by the College folks in Taloyoak: the biggest bucket of KFC chicken I could get there. I also was serving as a mule to carry cheques for another government agency to take to Gjoa Haven and Taloyoak. I got to the airport about 45 minutes early for a 12:30 departure.\nAnd I waited.\nAnd waited some more.\nIt was noon and I was hungry. I’d done everything to get ready except eat. Then I remembered a small package of caribou jerky I’d stuck in my pocket after the charity auction the weekend before. I ate the jerky slowly and, man, it really hit the spot.\nAuthor’s note: On the way out of Cambridge Bay, we flew over my house. Weeeee……\nThe Flight OUT\u003e The Flight OUT # The path from Cambridge Bay to Taloyoak The flight to Taloyoak was a milk run kind of affair with stops in other communities, Gjoa Haven, and Pelly Bay. The airline was FirstAir. Apparently it has a reputation for landing and taking off in any kind of weather and in this climate what choice would they have, really?\nI’ve forgotten the model number of the plane. It had two props, ample room for cargo in what would normally be the first class section of the plane and sat about 30 people (I would guess) in the rear.\nThe thing that struck me the most about the plane flight was the complete absence of gloss. No gloss here. On a commercial airline you expect to fly in womb-like comfort in an antiseptic environment designed to gloss over the animal herding incident that a plane flight really is. There are antiseptic seats, antiseptic noises and antiseptic diversions like today’s paper and headphones twinkling out elevator music. Some of these things were present on this flight: sure, we had seats, there were papers to read (News North and a Toronto Globe and Mail that looked ridiculously out of place), and there were things to eat.\nBut the entire experience was different. When the props revved up, the fuselage rattled and when you glanced at the rattling fuselage, you noticed the dented vents and the peeling paint. The flight attendant wore a jumpsuit, the kind you’d see on a jet pilot with zippers on the sides, back and across the chest. (Was she just dressed that way to be ready to jump out quickly?) And the food offered was all pre-packaged snack food. The people from the Christie company would be very pleased with the contract to supply this airline.\nThis was the reality and who could expect otherwise? With the extreme conditions, a person doesn’t expect frills. Think of how silly it seems to be transporting a grand piano by canoe to a new settlement. It just doesn’t fit in. Well, niceties and frills and fluff just don’t fit in here.\nOn the day of the flight the sun was setting at about 1:45 in the afternoon. The first leg of the trip to Gjoa Haven started in the light and gradually grew dark as we traveled East. The sun was orange on the horizon and it was a beautiful sight.\nThe ghost of the grand piano was on the plane though. It spoke to me. The French flight attendant would announce the safely regulations and again in English with a heavy French accent, and then a recorded voice would announce the same thing in Inuktitut, I assume. All this was squeaking out of tiny speakers that almost physically hurt my usually deaf ears.\nThat is all fine and dandy, but at seemingly random intervals a pre-recorded voice would announce something about the seat belts in a game show host voice that seemed completely out of place. Out of the blue a homogenized, filtered, groomed Bob Barker voice emits out of the squeaky larynx of the rattling old bones of the plane. An alien voice in this environment, and it was just tad bizarre.\nLanding in Gjoa Haven\u003e Landing in Gjoa Haven # When the announcement came that we were landing, I naturally looked out of the window anticipating the earth would be appearing larger and larger as we descended. No earth. We had descended into a cloud and the cloud didn’t seem to want to let go of the plane.\nStill no earth.\nI looked back at the newspaper I was reading. After about a minute there was still, you guessed it, no earth. I remember thinking \u0026ldquo;Land already!\u0026rdquo;\nThen the ground appeared briefly and the pilot was still making corrections on the approach. This made me nervous. We touched down with no incident and then I realized what was going on. We were in the middle of a snowstorm. The snow screamed down the runway and gave me the illusion that we were still flying.\nEveryone is required to leave the plane during refueling so we got a taste of the storm we’d just landed in. It wasn’t cold at all, but it was amazing that we had landed in this snow-filled soup. \u0026ldquo;Unbelievable,\u0026rdquo; I said out loud a few times both in and out of the airport waiting room.\nAfter the stay in the airport waiting room, after talking about the weather and musing about the pilot’s sanity, we took off amidst a definite murmur amongst the passengers. Would we make it or not? As it turned out, no problem. We lifted slowly off the runaway and the tundra melted into the darkness below.\nOn to Taloyoak\u003e On to Taloyoak # After about a forty-five minute flight, we landed in Pelly Bay. After a 15 or 20 minute wait, we continued on to Taloyoak. The flight took about 30 minutes this time. I got off the plane and wondered if the box with my tools and software had really followed me. I would be picking my nose and talking to the wall for two days if it didn’t. It was there.\nWhile in Gjoa Haven I met a couple of guys, Robert and Gary, who worked for the Power Corp. I’d met Robert, a Newfoundlander, in Cambridge Bay just couple days after he’d arrived in town. We made fools of ourselves on opposing teams of a hotly contested charades game. Anyway these guys were getting picked up by a Power Corp co-worker and invited me to travel into town with them. Louie, a great guy originally from Gjoa Haven, welcomed us and after we got our stuff (it did get there) we made our way into town, about a 2 km drive. We were all going to the same place, the Boothia Hotel.\nAh, the Boothia Hotel\u0026hellip;\u003e Ah, the Boothia Hotel\u0026hellip; # I had a $120 / night room (plus $60 for meals) with three single beds in it. That\u0026rsquo;s not a ridiculous hotel home charge these days, but remember, this was 1997. $120 was expensive! The room had a disabled sink, cupboards full of hotel supplies, soup, Kleenex etc, and a small 14\u0026quot; T.V. with no channels to watch. Notice I didn’t mention a bathroom? It was down the hall a bit.\nLater that night I found that this room was also…HOT! It was so hot I couldn’t sleep until 3:30 a.m. the first night. I’m staying in a hotel above the arctic circle and I’m complaining about the heat. Go figure. Actually there was a Yin / Yang to this: Gary, one of the Power Corp. guys was in a nearby room and he was freezing the first night, so much so that he opened his door into the hallway just to let in some warm air.\nWhile on the topic of sleeping, I should skip ahead to the second night. I was suddenly sharing my room with someone else. A fellow asked at the supper table (at which guests are fed a $30.00 supper) \u0026ldquo;Who is I Room 3?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;That would be me,\u0026rdquo; I said.\n\u0026ldquo;I snore,\u0026rdquo; was the first thing he said.\n\u0026ldquo;You’re looking a man frown deeply,\u0026rdquo; I said.\nI have traveled before. This ain’t my first time. I’ve slept on floors of boats crossing the English Channel, in youth hostels in Europe, Canada and Japan. And I really can’t stand snoring. I have learned to ALWAYS take ear plugs with me when I travel, just in case. Well do you think that I remembered them as I looked forward to sleeping in my $120 / night room? NOPE.\nThat night he snored. I was dog tired from a big day’s work and not having slept the night before and I’d taken a sleeping pill to make sure I got my sleep that night. But that night he snored and I woke up four times throughout the night, even after being \u0026ldquo;drugged up\u0026rdquo; with a sleeping pill. At the five o’clock waking I got my pants on rather noisily to wake him up and informed him curtly he was snoring. He was a very nice man, and was very apologetic and we actually joked about the whole matter at breakfast. But, in a way, I guess this paragraph is my revenge. Maybe this goes to show you \u0026ldquo;The pen is mightier than the snored.\u0026rdquo; apologies for that\nDoing The Job\u003e Doing The Job # In Taloyoak Backing up a bit, the work during the day went very well for the most part. After an initial hour and a half of torture, the computers started to behave and fall into a routine of being upgraded with hardware and software. I was very happy with how things went in Taloyoak. I actually had to THINK, experiment and use some problem solving abilities to get the job done. I actually felt fear when things didn’t go right during the first part of the morning. This made what turned out to be a successful job so much more satisfying in the end.\nTaloyoak as a town was very interesting. I could tell things were more traditionally Inuit there. Stop signs were in English and syllabics. My new face was definitely noticed as I walked to the Co-op with Denise Ouellet, the Office Administration instructor. I remember three different kids coming up to me and saying \u0026ldquo;Who are you?\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;What’s your name?\u0026rdquo; All in all, as a white person I felt more isolated in the town. This maybe isn’t a fair take, but those were definitely my feelings during the short time I was there. It shed a little light on my experience in Cambridge Bay, because Cambridge, I realized only now, had much more white influence everywhere.\nThe town of Taloyoak was built around two bays and the terrain is hilly and rocky, a big difference from Cambridge Bay. The sun was setting during the noon hour and the sunsets were really beautiful with the rugged rocks of the bay in the foreground.\nIf you look at these image and see a pretty but not spectacular sunset, you might think, \u0026ldquo;So, what?!\u0026rdquo; But remember I took these sunset pictures just after 12 noon.\nAs I was leaving town I was given a ride to the airport by Louie, the same kind soul that drove his Power Corp. co-workers and me into town from the airport. Louie and I somehow got into a 10 minute conversation about racism. It was interesting to talk to such an open person.\nThe Return\u003e The Return # The flight to Cambridge Bay was direct and, really quite uneventful. I sat beside a fellow who worked for the cable company and had been in Pelly Bay for the last two months, away from his family, I gathered. He talked about doing pole work, but he was hardly dressed for the winter though. He was going to Yellowknife, then Edmonton and then east to Iqaluit. I mentioned that it was going to be a long hard trip. \u0026ldquo;I don’t mind,\u0026rdquo; was the understated answer. He wanted OUT.\nWhen I left Cambridge Bay, I felt like I was getting out of jail. When I returned, for the first time, it felt like I was returning home to a place of familiarity at least. That night I slept in my bed, had a bath in my bathtub ate my food.\nIt was good to be back.\n","date":"August 8, 2020","permalink":"/posts/a-trip-to-taloyoak/","section":"","summary":"A complete - fairly long - account of a trip from Cambridge Bay, Nunavut to Gjoa Haven, Pelly Bay and finally Taloyak.","title":"A Trip to Taloyoak"},{"content":" My 2020 Commentary on this Content Written in 1998\u003e My 2020 Commentary on this Content Written in 1998 # This post is about an afternoon quad ride out of town with a co-worker, Brian S. and his girlfriend Tracey a nurse. Our goal was to get to “Mount” Pelly, a bump on the horizon and the highest point in this region of Victoria Island. What made the trip memorable was that it was snowing with a strong wind the whole time we were traveling, making for a challenging, but fun, almost other-worldly experience.\n“Mount” Pelly is an esker and is called “Uvayuq” in inuktitut, the native language of the Inuit.\nI know this now because Wikipedia told me so. There was no Wikipedia the day we undertook this trip. It would first appear a little over 2 years later. Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uvayuq\nSaturday, September 27, 1997\nAfter a morning of taking pictures, I returned to town, a little cool and a bit hungry. I had some lunch and dressed up very well, with heavy-bibbed ski pants, my winter parka, and leather gauntlet mitts. I was VERY glad I did. Comment in 2020: these winter clothes were purchased just before coming to Cambridge Bay. I still have them all, except the large mitts which have vanished to somewhere. Even though I live in Edmonton, Alberta now, known for having its share of cold winters, these clothes are generally too just much for an Edmonton winter. I’ve only worn the whole get-up together once in the last 22 years and that was for a -40 C crazy mid-winter hike a few years ago.\nI met Brain and Tracey at Tim\u0026rsquo;s where they were borrowing an ATV. Just as we headed out, it started to snow. As we made our way to Mount Pelly, the snow blew straight into our faces. I swore at myself for not wearing my glasses at least. I could have chosen a helmet with a visor. NO. Apparently I chose pain.\nAbout 10 or 15 minutes out of town we saw four large swans in a pond. It is quite unusual for swans to be hanging around these parts at this time of the year. Just as we stopped, the four of them spooked and started to take off. That was a beautiful sight. The wings had power, while the landing gear flippered feet seemed to walk them along the water.\nWe made our way to Mount Pelly on the windy road. It was fun trying to avoid the puddles across the road. Because my lack of appropriate face covering, I was squinting hard the whole way. It was a constant struggle to adjust my balaclava so that the least amount of snow would fly into my eyes. It was one those times when driving slowly would have meant less pain but a longer ride. Driving faster would make for a shorter trip, but more pain. What to do?!\nA blurry picture of Grant on the quad I was on the quad alone, so as we left the road, going across the raw rocky tundra was fun for me. The furrowed cut lines created by yearly run off were fun to buck over. You had to have your wits about you to avoid sharp rocks, bad lines of attack, all the while trying to get to where you thought you wanted to go.\nWe stopped the quads pretty much at the foot of the \u0026ldquo;mountain.\u0026rdquo; Anywhere else, Mount Pelly would be thought of as large-ish hill, but because this is flat, arctic tundra, this is called a “mountain”. It’s all relative.\nWe trudged up the slope into the now heavy blowing snow. It was surreally real. We found a big rock to lean on and Tracey broke out the hot chocolate and Bailey\u0026rsquo;s. NUM NUM. Then we pretty much just sat.\nBrian and Tracey And those moments of sitting in the blowing snow will make up the mental snapshot of the trip that will remain with me the longest.\nI thought about people living in this harsh environment. It wasn\u0026rsquo;t terribly cold, but if a person\u0026rsquo;s stomach was empty, there wasn\u0026rsquo;t much chance of hunting much in this kind of weather. We talked about it. My initial conception is that it is such an inhospitable land. Given the choice, I really wonder why people didn\u0026rsquo;t migrate south and even fight for the opportunity to migrate if need be. Why here? I hope to get this question partially answered.\nI really felt content just lying down on the wind packed snow. The atmosphere was filled with blowing snow, visibility had worsened during the 15 minutes of our rest stop. The wind blew by, through, and around you. On the ground small lichen covered rocks were resigned to being covered in snow for another season. Blades of grass were covered in sheathes of ice many times their thickness. Was this a protective ice covering, or a clear coffin for them?\nWe decided to make our way back since the visibility was deteriorating so quickly. The lay of the land on the way back was all downhill and the telling of the story will reflect that. We motored very quickly back to town, this time with the wind at our backs. Again it was fun making the twisty turns on the quad. This time the puddles were less of a factor because may were simply covered with snow. Driving through them didn\u0026rsquo;t make a splash, just a slushy tire track.\nIn all likelihood, that will be the last trek out onto the land this season. The snow seems to be staying. The cold weather is creeping in. Let it. After returning the quad, and going back home, I wrapped up the day with a steaming hot bath with a hot cup of coffee. \u0026ldquo;AHHHHHH,\u0026rdquo; I said, as I turned lobster red.\n","date":"August 5, 2020","permalink":"/posts/snowblind-on-a-quad/","section":"","summary":"During my 10-month stay in Cambridge Bay, any chance to get out of town to was a chance not only to explore, but also escape.","title":"Snowblind on a Quad"},{"content":"My commentary in 2020\u003e My commentary in 2020 # During my time in Cambridge Bay, I was able to borrow someone’s all-terrain vehicle (ATV, but we generally call them “quads”) only a few times. This page on the website was about the first time I was able to venture out of town on a borrowed machine and that made the \u0026ldquo;get out of jail free\u0026rdquo; trip so special. The local description for traveling away from civilization onto the arctic tundra is going “out on the land.”\nSaturday, September 6 was a big day for me. It was the first time I had the chance to venture out of town onto the tundra with a vehicle. Quads and of course snow mobiles (we generally call them “sleds”) are a fixture here. Young reckless drivers use them to roar noisily down the streets; mothers and dads use them to transport their kids and \u0026ldquo;stuff\u0026rdquo; around.\nI didn’t understand the power and the necessity of these things until today.\nDanielle M., a co-worker, had had the opportunity to take a trip a week before and came back raving about it. She said she was hooked, that she loved those quads, that she had to go again. I listened and couldn’t help feeling happy for her fundamental excitement about the day. I was also really jealous and told her so. I wanted - needed - to take a trip out.\nUnderstand, at this point I didn’t think I really needed to escape town. There was no hustle and bustle of city life to get away from, no rat race of human kind. It wasn’t escaping the bright lights of the big city. Heck, some of the brightest lights here are the lights that flash when you open the fridge door. (I guess that’s why I’m drawn to mine so often).\nNo, the need to get away was more of a quiet knowledge that this little blip on the tip of a huge island in the Arctic Ocean called Cambridge Bay was not even the beginning of a representation of the reality of the world around me. That reality was surrounding the small town and the only real glimpse I’d had of that was the five minutes I’d seen when the plane landed when I first arrived and a short walk out of town one afternoon.\nGetting gassed up before the trip I knew I wanted to take a trip out and Suz B., the Office Administration instructor, hadn’t had a chance to see the outside of town yet either. Vicki B., our part-time boss, benefactor, and mom kindly lent us her quad and a helmet. After using a bike pump to give a slow leaking tire some air and then a fill with gas and some serious compressed air and some needed helmets loaned by Nicole and Howard B., we were ready to venture out. I drove with Suz hanging on (for dear life) on the back of the seat.\nA part of me wants to ask you to hum the opening riff to “Born to be Wild” right now. But really I wasn’t too wild. I’d driven these things before on a friends farm. I’d even driven the three-wheeled kind that were eventually banned because they were so inherently unstable and dangerous. But it was the first time I’ve driven one of these things while having another human life other than my own to worry about. There was a bit of a learning curve, but after a couple of silly gear shifts, I had the hang of it.\nIt only took about ten minutes of driving to realize that I really felt FREE. An old murky photo, but this is the view of Cambridge Bay from just across the inlet to the east of town. Despite what I said about the urge to go out of town NOT being to escape town, I suddenly realized that part of the joy really WAS escaping the town. What’s with that? There on the tundra is a town of about 1400 people, about 30 of whom I have met. And I have the urge to get away from it? Now this must be come basic kind of urge inside of me. I didn’t feel at all cooped up anymore. I was FREE!\nSuz and Grant at the old stone church, just outside of Cambridge Bay The goal was Mt. Pelly, a large hill north of Cambridge Bay.\nAbout 10 to 15 minutes ride out of town I spied a couple of brown shapes off to the right, and after a half minute more, I was sure. We were seeing two musk-oxen about 500 yards away. Now, realize that I have never in my life written the phrase “two musk-oxen” much less seen the creatures, so this was a treat. We went off the road and I had my first experience driving on the true tundra.\nThe ground varied quickly from jutting rocks to green pools of swamp to suspiciously lush grass circles that looked like you could disappear into. I circled behind a ridge, found a fairly level section to climb it and slowly maneuvered the quad toward the musk-oxen. We could see them about 200 yards away - I would guess - on the other side of a crystal clear pond. Suz and I walked down to the pond with our cameras. I also took my binoculars.\nWalking across the ground made me forget about the animals staring at us suspiciously from their spot across the pond. The rock was surrounded by pillowy mounds of muskeg. It was such a strange sensation to step on rock and quickly to a soft foamy substance that was the earth. Lichens covered the rocks in colours from bright oranges to yellow-greens to green and black. Then at the lake the design of the reddish rocks under the clear pond water distracted me again. Apparently I’m easily distracted. The design was beautiful and it was well\u0026hellip;just\u0026hellip;there.\nSuz has a 75-200 mm zoom lens, so she took the pics of the musk-oxen while I spied them through my binoculars, which gave a great close up view. I must admit, they are strange looking animals. I had touched a muskox hide the day before in town and knew the outer wool was fine like human hair and closer to the skin it was even more fine. Their horns curled around the sides of their head and large tufts of furs bunched up behind their heads.\nBoth were stone still. Each stood and stared at us intently, but didn’t move the whole time we were there. It was a neat experience to see these animals. We’d heard that we wouldn’t see any because they were already gone from the area. These two had forgotten to leave it seems.\nSuz and quad Suz - This small, dark image is all I had from the original website\nBack on the road, the next sights were the little shack tents and cabins built close to the road to Mount Pelly. To someone from a city, not used to wide open spaces, an image of these little structures might mean loneliness. But what struck me about them was the diminutive size of them in relation to the treeless rock and muskeg and rocky earth around them. They seemed to be a good symbol of where man really stands in this environment.\nAlong the road too were small piles of rock, probably built to pass the time. Some were simple pillars of one rock on another. Others were more elaborate markers. The rock piles that were built up in the shape of human beings are called Inukshuks and are now an international symbol of friendship.\nGrant on his borrowed quad Suz and I went to the far side of Mount Pelly because that’s where the road lead (rookies!). After the path got too treacherous and wet and muddy, we turned around and stopped at the foot of Pelly overlooking a small lake with an island just off the shore. A rock fire pit had been use there before, so we were by no means the first people there, but it was very nice spot. We broke out the hot chocolate that Vicki made for us, broke out the cookies that Vicki made for us and also some bread with cream cheese I brought. Suz’s peanut butter sandwiches are squashed out of all recognition by this time.\nIt tasted SO good.\nAfter a bit I climbed up the hill to see what I could see. All along the side of the hill were holes under rocks that I assume now were lemming borrows. At the the top of the the third plateau I stopped and truly looked around.\nIt was a different world from here. I didn’t know if it was a land dotted by lakes or lakes dotted by land. The sun was straining to get out at this point, so the light changed the view almost every minute. Standing on this large hill, looking across the tundra made me feel small. What I saw was grand and powerful just by being there. The petty worries I have throughout the day, I now associated with being inside four walls, cramped like the cramped thinking it is. All that was so small compared to the size and power of this sight.\nSuz and I started our journey back to town after gathering a small rock each from Mount Pelly, and a couple of feathers I found snagged to the grass. We made a few stops on the way to take pictures and to pick up a piece of muskox fur laying on the ground just off the road.\nGetting back to town was a strange experience. I smelled humans again: garbage smoke and some fuel in the air. On the other hand, for the first time I felt like I was returning to the comfort of HOME.\n","date":"August 2, 2020","permalink":"/posts/out-on-the-land/","section":"","summary":"Sure, it was just a quad ride out of town, but it was also my first chance to escape the what was becoming the prison of being in Cambridge Bay for too long.","title":"Out on the Land"},{"content":"My 2020 Commentary\u003e My 2020 Commentary # This little piece is about a jaunt out of town just across a small bay to the east where the rotting hulk of a boat sits on the shoreline. The story starts out about the prospect of being able to leave town, but then, when I start hunting for photographic subjects, it becomes about leaving my normal way of seeing and thinking to get into the “photographer” zone of seeing the world.\nIt’s Saturday, September 27, 1997 and the weather was still holding. Most people have been saying that the icing up of the water in the bay is unusually late this year. So the available time for being able to roam out of town on a quad was fast decreasing.\nThis Saturday morning was chilly. No question. As I walked over to Vicki B.’s house to borrow her ATV (hereafter known a the “quad”), I puffed out some breath. I could almost blow \u0026ldquo;breath rings.\u0026rdquo; It was an overcast day and there was a chill in the air.\nBut the weather was still holding. There wasn\u0026rsquo;t four feet of snow on the ground. It wasn\u0026rsquo;t -25 °C. There was still another chance for what could be the last outing, the last escape from town for the next few months.\nI picked up the quad and helmet, pumped up one of tires with a bike pump - it has a slow leak - and got ready to go. Brian S., a co-worker, and his girlfriend Tracey, a nurse, wanted to go on a ride in the afternoon, but I was itching to go in the morning. We were planning on going to Mount Pelly again, this time toward the front side of the \u0026ldquo;mountain.\u0026rdquo;\nI started off east of town and decided to go to the old stone church again. I wanted to explore the side of the bay opposite the town site and take some pictures, despite the overcast weather that made things seem a little dreary.\nFlashback: One of the first lessons in the first photography book I every bought suggested going into your back yard and taking a roll of pictures (ummm, these were the ancient days when cameras used film) of the most mundane things in the yard. This would teach a person to look at everything around them in a different light. This was the state of mind I fell into after I passed the churchyard and gazed across the bay toward the town site of Cambridge Bay. I started just looking quietly at things, part hunter, part priest.\nThe first obvious thing to take a picture of was a boat stranded on the shoreline, propped up where it had been left for years and years. An information sign nearby said that one of the original priests of the stone church bought the boat and had it towed from Tuktoyaktuk. Apparently, it leaked all the way. And by the time it arrived, the priest had been stationed elsewhere. No one was sure what plans he had for the boat. It just sits there, a carcass of an idea, a carcass of a boat.\nA pair of carcasses At first, such an obvious object is a magnet for a picture. After all, the visual stimulation on the tundra is a bit sparse. Sure, you have your rocks and your boulders and your ponds and your…Wait…that\u0026rsquo;s ALL you\u0026rsquo;ve got.\nI was trying to get into the picture composing frame of mind. And trying to get a tasteful shot of the boat was difficult because the first impulse to take a picture of it was merely because it was there and stuck out in what was mostly moonscape around it. But the hunter / priest see-the-world-with-a-child\u0026rsquo;s-eye thing kicked in. I got what I hope is a good shot of the decaying hulk of the boat, with a carcass of what was probably a caribou in front of it. That got me going.\nThe rocks in the crusty snow, suddenly looked like a Japanese rock garden. How do you capture that? A black rock had come cool bright orange lichen on it. What could I do with that?\nOn the tundra, any colour catches your eye. The ATV I was riding idled patiently about 50 feet away, slowly burning its fuel. A part of my \u0026ldquo;creative fuel\u0026rdquo; was starting to burn too.\n","date":"July 31, 2020","permalink":"/posts/taking-pics/","section":"","summary":"This little piece is about a jaunt out of Cambridge Bay just across a small bay to the east where the rotting hulk of a boat sits on the shoreline.","title":"Taking Pics"},{"content":" The finished igloo at night. Soon after the group “igloo building bee”, the first brave souls to sleep in the igloo (the first night after we built the thing on March 22, 1998) were Doug S., Suzanne and Alex T. The rest of us had VERY legitimate excuses not to sleep in the igloo all night in -30°C weather. (Yeah, right) Well, they reported the next day that they were warm, and aside from some reports of strange dreams, all was well.\nThe next shift about a week(?) later was to be Tim S., Keith W. (a visiting CBC \u0026ldquo;producer for hire\u0026rdquo; from Vancouver), me and Suz B. At the last minute a sleeping bag Suz thought she had lined up didn\u0026rsquo;t materialize so she dropped out. Doug, our igloo builder, decided to join us for what would be his second night in this igloo.\nWe started to get ready to \u0026ldquo;move in\u0026rdquo; at about ten o\u0026rsquo;clock. We went to Doug\u0026rsquo;s place where we collected a bunch of caribou hides, a muskox hide and even a grizzly bear hide, all of which would serve as insulation on the floor of the igloo.\nAll four of the guys slated to sleep in the igloo. l-r: Me, Doug S., and Keith W., and Tim S. Just before we all finally got into the igloo and sealed the door from the inside to keep in the warmth that would be created by a lantern and our body heat, I took the chance to rid myself yet once more of that pesky body fluid so I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t feel the need to get up in the night.\nThis was no small thing to consider. And you have to understand that when you’re in an igloo for the night, you’re IN. Once everyone’s inside, the door is sealed shut by maneuvering a snow block into place and then packing the cracks with snow. Of course this is necessary to trap the heat inside during the night.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s funny that the whole time getting ready for this venture, this “no escape” and therefore “no pee\u0026quot; factor was the heaviest weight on my mind.\nThe igloo was situated on the west edge of town. It was quiet and DARK. There’s very little light pollution even on the edge of a small town in the arctic, so the stars really made an impression on me. Everywhere I\u0026rsquo;ve gone in the world, the familiar constellations have been there to remind me that no matter how different it might be on the ground, I’m still living under the same night sky.\nIt was a tight fit for four guys. The Big Dipper was there that night and the North Star was almost straight overhead. You had to tilt your head back to see pin point it. It’s the arctic, right?\nMore group shots We got all the sleeping bags and skins into the igloo by about 11 p.m. and started to settle down to choose places. Doug started the Coleman lantern which was going to be our sole source of heat. All of the sudden, being on the outside wall of the four sleepers wasn\u0026rsquo;t a good thing. I was the tallest of the bunch so pretty much had to be in the middle two sleepers just so I could fit.\nWe rummaged through the sleeping bags, tried to get comfy and in time had our spots and positions for the night. And my goodness it was tight for this six foot tall guy.\nDoug had brought along a good number of bags and a couple including mine were spread across everyone. There was no problem with keeping warm. The sensation was strange on the nose, though, because the air was cold and the steam would billow out the nostrils with every exhalation. Just a nose sticking out of the sleeping bag. All in all, the sleep was like a camping sleep to me. (That means it took me LONG time to get to sleep and I only ever slept lightly, it seemed). The cold wasn\u0026rsquo;t a factor at all, but the comfort level was. I finally went to sleep after a long while of staring at the snow dome over me.\nIt was a great experience sleeping in the igloo I\u0026rsquo;d helped to build.\nThe epilogue? Well after waking at about 7:00 a.m. we parted slowly. Doug and I sealed up the igloo again from the outside, because we\u0026rsquo;d left all the hides and bags inside for the day.\nI made the 10 minute walk home and after looking at the clock I realized that I was exactly on schedule with my usual morning routine. I had to laugh out loud. What a strange feeling. You sleep IN the elements over night and the routine of the work-a-day world grabs you again and makes you march. To top it off I then got a phone call from the computer lab at work: \u0026ldquo;Grant, what\u0026rsquo;s the password for Computer #4?\u0026rdquo;\nThis age\u0026rsquo;s BEAST never lets go of you Virginia.\n","date":"July 29, 2020","permalink":"/posts/sleeping-in-an-igloo/","section":"","summary":"After an igloo building bee, and hearing the stories from the brave women who were first to try out sleeping overnight in the little dome, it was the guys turn.","title":"Sleeping in an Igloo"},{"content":"My commentary in 2020\u003e My commentary in 2020 # Helping to build and later sleep in an igloo still remains a strong memory from my time in Cambridge Bay.

In the original version I included everyone’s family name, but I’ve decided to edit those here just in case privacy is a factor for those involved. The real reason we were able to get an igloo built at all was because Doug S. knew the skill and art necessary to construct one. The rest of us just cut snow blocks for him to do his thing. Doug was originally from the Toronto area (I believe) and lived pretty much like a traditional Inuk. He seemed to knew more about the traditional Inuit ways than any of the younger generation. I honestly forget the level of gratitude for his work that I had at the time, but I certainly feel the gratitude now.

I still remember the leaving Saskatoon airport to travel first to Los Angeles on my way to Japan. That was a trip that took me into a decidedly different world.\nWell, although I wasn’t leaving Canada, this trip was taking me yet again into a different kind of “other” world: to Cambridge Bay, a hamlet of about 1400 people, situated on a very large slab of tundra called Victoria Island just off the mainland of North America, and just inside of the arctic circle.\nWhen you’re going to that kind of place, the trip seems memorable. This page on my Arctic Slice of Life website was attempt to describe that one day of travel. This post is quite text-heavy, not many pictures. After all, I didn\u0026rsquo;t own a digital camera; they were expensive at that time. And besides, I was sitting in a plane for most of the day! 😀\nIntroduction\u003e Introduction # This day was a special day because so much had been leading towards it for about two months. This was the day I got to stop TALKING about going north to work. This was the day I actually got on a plane and went to Cambridge Bay, NWT. (NWT = Northwest Territories, and the region of Nunavut was formed a year a after I left.)\nI knew the day would be on one level filled with planes and waiting and lazy disinterested flipping of plane seat pouch magazines and newspapers. On another level it was a physical acting out of a passage into another life experience.That doesn’t happen too often in anyone’s life.\nI had lived in Tisdale, Saskatchewan and worked at Cumberland Regional College in both Melfort and later Tisdale since February, 1988. Now in August, 1997, about nine years later, I was physically moving to another reality. The sinew connecting these two pieces of my life, nine years at Cumberland and the future, was this day long journey.\nThe Flight\u003e The Flight # I started out for Cambridge Bay from the Saskatoon Ramada hotel at 4:45 a.m. to catch a 6:00 a.m. plane. I was packing five large bags, two hockey bag size stuffed with clothes, hard drives, some cutlery, towels, vitamins, etc., etc. This was the baggage I was allowed to bring on the flight, the excess being paid by Nunavut Arctic College, my new employer.\nThe trip north made for a long day. The trip from Saskatoon to Edmonton was made via Calgary all on a Dash-8, which seats about 30 people. This is a walk-out-on-the-tarmack, walk-up-the-steps-(turn around and wave one final goodbye to my public)-strap-you-in, give-you-peanuts-and-a-coke and now-be-quiet and don’t-ask-for-anything-else kind of trip. I think you get the picture.\nThe Route I had about a 3 hour wait in Edmonton airport where I went through some very personal memories of a life turning point incident that once happened there. That’s all I have to say about that, and other than thinking about that I just walked around looking at people coming and going.\nThe flight from Edmonton to Yellowknife, NWT was on a 727 and we were given ready made ham and cheese sandwiches with dessert and coffee. (Note that FOOD will be a common theme/obsession for reporting throughout) This was better than the last flight but we’re not talking in-flight movie and an unlimited bar situation here, not that I crave that kind of thing.\nYellowknife is on the north shore of Great Slave Lake, my trusty En Route Air Canada magazine told me. There was a 2 1/2 hour wait there so I just lounged around the airport. La-dee-da.\nThe flight to Cambridge Bay was on a 737 and I began to notice (quick witted sleuth that I am) that there was something different about these NWT Air planes. I was in row 10 and found myself two seats from the front of the plane. \u0026ldquo;What\u0026rsquo;s with this? I said. My spidey sense was tingling. Well the first class section of the plane was all converted into a cargo area. A First Air plane on the tarmack (taken during a later trip) Now, people who have seen this a thousand times will laugh at this deep observation. This is in the \u0026ldquo;water is wet\u0026rdquo; category to people in the North. But when you think about it, the cargo is darn important here. Getting stuff to people is just as important \u0026ndash; and probably more lucrative for the airline if they are anything like trains \u0026ndash; as getting people to a place. And you generally don\u0026rsquo;t have to serve peanuts and coke to cargo.\nThe assumption in the back of my mind was that I was travelling further and further into the boonies. Even if this was a pretty safe assumption, the food on this flight was best yet during my trip: chicken or stuffed pork was the choice. I throttled the urge to say \u0026ldquo;Both\u0026rdquo;! when asked what I wanted. I ordered the chicken and it was heavenly.\nThe Happening\u003e The Happening # Now get this, because it\u0026rsquo;s one of those Twilight Zone things. I happened to look at my watch a few time throughout the flight and just before we landed in Cambridge Bay, I noticed that my Seiko watch had STOPPED! Wow, big deal, you say. Well I have been wearing this watch almost every day for the past ten years! A good friend, Kinue Matsue, gave it to me as a going away present the day before I left Japan. That departure for me was an important time in my life. I was going back to Canada, to friends and family, but also to the unknown. Now, to begin this excursion to another \u0026ldquo;unknown,\u0026rdquo; the watch stops. In a sense, it puts a bookend on that portion of my life.\nMy Seiko Watch Am I reading too much into a stopped watch? Maybe. Probably. But my first gut reaction was\nnee, nee, nee, nee,\nnee, nee, nee, nee,\nnee, nee, nee, nee.\nThis is a sad attempt to type out the Twilight Zone theme. I will stop for a moment while you do it OUT LOUD. Isn\u0026rsquo;t this internet thing cool: you can get multimedia sound and everything!\nSo this was my trip to Cambridge Bay. Exciting? Boring? Thought provoking? Mind numbing? Yes, that day of travel was all of those things to me.\n","date":"July 22, 2020","permalink":"/posts/traveling-to-cambridge-bay/","section":"","summary":"This is my account of the trip north from Saskatoon, SK, to Calgary, AB, then Edmonton, AB, then Yellowknife, NWT and finally Cambridge Bay, NWT (now Nunavut).","title":"Traveling to Cambridge Bay"},{"content":"So, Where is Cambridge Bay and What Does it Look Like?\u003e So, Where is Cambridge Bay and What Does it Look Like? # Aerial Photo of Cambridge Bay (photo credit unknown) On August 25, 1997, I got on a plane bound for Cambridge Bay, Nunavut (then still the Northwest Territories).\nWhy was I going? In short, after nine years of working at a regional college in northeast Saskatchewan, I’d decided it was time for a change in my life. And in retrospect, when I’ve made changes in my life, I’ve often made fairly dramatic changes. This was one of those dramatic changes. Sure, to make a job change, I guess I could have waited for a smaller swing of the life pendulum to come my way, but the opportunity presented itself in the form of a job posting in the coffee room of one of the College offices one day while I was visiting. I’d been contemplating making a change for a good while already and the prospect of working in a place so alien to my experience seemed like an adventuresome way to make the break into something new and different.\nI remember doing a phone interview while sitting on floor of my living room, using the coffee table Japanese kotatsu-style. I remember thinking the interview went well. I also remember my Dad pretty much trying to talk me out of considering the move: “It’s probably a case of anyone who puts their hand up will be chosen to go up there,” he said. I didn’t know if there was any truth in that then, but I was determined to make a change so it’s probably quite obvious by now I was offered the job and I decided to accept the offer. In retrospect, I should say that my Dad was probably right. Nonetheless, I’m glad I followed the that path, despite the negative aspects of living and working in such an isolated environment, which I’ll get into in later post in the series.\nSo I made my exit from the regional college, leaving nine years of experiences, work relationships and relinquishing my position of number two on the union seniority list. And I was eventually on my way to Cambridge Bay.\nSo, Where is Cambridge Bay, Anyway?\u003e So, Where is Cambridge Bay, Anyway? # A map showing Cambridge Bay in context of the arctic circle and tree line in northern Canada The hamlet of Cambridge Bay is situated just off the North American mainland, on the southern part of Victoria Island. This unique map shows where Cambridge Bay is in relation to both the arctic circle and the northern edge of the tree line to the south.\nThe definition of the arctic circle is well known: it’s the point where “the Sun is above the horizon for 24 continuous hours at least once per year (and therefore visible at midnight) and below the horizon for 24 continuous hours at least once per year (and therefore not visible at noon)” ( Source)\nThe idea of the “tree line” may not be so well known. Just like at the tree line of a mountain where you find trees won’t grow at high altitudes, the environment north of the dotted line on the map will not sustain full-grown trees, although shrubs may grow sparingly just north of the line. Once you get as far the latitude of 69 degrees north, where Cambridge Bay is, there are no trees of any kind.\nHaving been born and raised in Saskatchewan, I’ve endured the comments and misconceptions of temporary visitors or “non-visitors” to the province: that the whole place is flat and treeless. That may be largely true in the southern part of the province along the Trans-Canada highway. But “my Saskatchewan” isn’t like that at all. I happened to have grown up about a 45 minute drive from the tree line in north central Saskatchewan, meaning north of that line (and extending north to the dotted line you see in the map above) there are nothing but trees. Since “my Saskatchewan” was very well-forested, it was certainly a adjustment to see the absolutely treeless and even shrub-less landscape surrounding Cambridge Bay. Was it a surprise or a shock? No, not at all, but it was an adjustment, no question.\nWant to Learn a Bit More?\u003e Want to Learn a Bit More? # For more history and information about Cambridge Bay, check out the Wikipedia article about the town. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambridge_Bay\n","date":"July 19, 2020","permalink":"/posts/where-is-cambridge-bay/","section":"","summary":"This post is all about Cambridge Bay, Nunavut, Canada.

One example is Knight Lab\u0026rsquo;s TimelineJS. For practice, I decided to create a Timeline of the studio albums REM released over the years. You\u0026rsquo;ll find it below, but first, why REM albums? They aren\u0026rsquo;t a band I know and love from my youth. Nonetheless, their music has been infused into my brain and I doubt by brain will purge it. And that\u0026rsquo;s a good thing; I like having their music rattling around in there.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s the thing: starting in my middle-age years, one thing led to another and it seems I just kind of gradually became an REM fan.\nMy first conscious memory of being aware of REM was while I was house-sitting in Cambridge Bay, Nunavut while I finishing up a 10-month teaching contract at Nunavut Arctic College. I discovered a cassette tape in the music collection of the people I was house-sitting for. It had a big blue dog on the cover. I think I may have been aware the album was by REM, but not knowing any better, I dubbed it the \u0026ldquo;Blue Dog\u0026rdquo; album.\nLater I found out the album was called Monster, but the most important thing was that I really liked the music on it. What struck me about it was that no two songs seemed to sound the same on the album. That was different: usually bands have their \u0026ldquo;sound\u0026rdquo; and songs are simply variations on that sound. That\u0026rsquo;s a overstatement, I know, but REM\u0026rsquo;s sound was from all over the musical spectrum it seemed to me and that\u0026rsquo;s what I liked about them. Obviously, these were musicians that didn\u0026rsquo;t surrender to the path of least resistance and do the same thing over and over again.\nIn Feb, 2007, completely out of the blue I suffered a detached retina.

Yeah, that\u0026rsquo;s about it, really.\nBut while doing that, we did manage to make our way up a decently sized hill.\nAnd to do that we travelled by quad and at times, two of us at least, on foot when the terrain got too dicey for doubling up on the quads. It was a 20 km round trip along grassy, hummocky terrain, deteriorating former roads, and around and through a LOT of bathtub- and small swimming pool-sized mud holes.\nWas it worth it? You’re damn right it was. Here’s what happened.\nStaging\u003e Staging # After meeting at a restaurant mid-morning, we made our way west out of town in a convoy of three trucks, Dwaine and Bryan with their quads as cargo.\nAfter leaving Highway 2 and travelling about 9km south on Canyon Creek Road, we came to a convenient, but pretty muddy pull out. This was near the “Amazing Tree” cache, where we planned to start our trek today.\nBryan, Hugh and I left Dwaine to unload his quad while we scampered further south to find a cache that Dwaine had hidden about a week ago. The road near the cache was muddy and in fact a truck was stuck in the mud fairly close to the cache when we arrived. With the help of a buddy, they’d gotten themselves unstuck and were gone by the time we all were ready to make the walk over to the cache. It was found quickly and we all signed in as “First to Find”-ers.\n![Finding the \u0026ldquo;What 4\u0026rdquo; cache.](IMG_4002-nonumber-610x813-1.jpeg \u0026ldquo;Finding the \u0026ldquo;What 4\u0026rdquo; cache.\u0026rdquo;)\nOnce we returned to staging area and were ready to go, the two-quad convoy began with the first stop being the “Amazing Tree” a cache and a tree which were unfortunately mostly destroyed in the 2011 Slave Lake wildfire. Even so, that tree is still a sight to see.\nWe then struck out eastward across a few spots with fairly challenging terrain, but tame compare to what we’d see later in the trip. The next major waypoint was meeting up with the road that once connected the area near Grizzly Ridge to the south with Highway 2 which passes through Slave Lake and the city dump to the west where this road originates.\nIt’s a Road That Has Seen Better Days\u003e It’s a Road That Has Seen Better Days # The road is no doubt a shadow of what it once was, the little traffic it sees not damaging the weeds that are beginning to reclaim it.\nNot too long later we reached the steel hulk of a bridge that had been burnt out by the 2011 Slave Lake wildfire and subsequently dragged up the hill from the creek it once crossed. There’s a cache, “Burnt Bridge”, hidden here by Bryan, one of our group, so three of us dismounted and began our search for it. It took a while, but Dwaine was finally able to come up with the goods. Having the owner the cache with us tossing out hints didn’t hurt either.\nThe next leg of the trip was relatively straightforward. We were on a actual road, with only minor obstacles to go around or over. That was the case until we got to “Grizzly Gateway”, another new waypoint on the earth now named for a geocache hidden there.\nPast the Gateway, Things Get Gnarly\u003e Past the Gateway, Things Get Gnarly # Bryan makes his way through the gateway Past the “gateway”, that is, past where any four-wheeled vehicle has gone for years and I dare say no four-wheel vehicle could go these days, the trail gets real gnarly.\nMy track log shows that the 2.8 km of trail to the top of the ridge took me 1 hour and 25 minutes to travel. That’s because the obstacles the quads met in this section, one getting briefly stuck in a bog and both being stopped up by a large piece of deadfall that had to be chainsawed into pieces and removed before we could continue.\nAnd as a passenger there were spots where it just wouldn’t have been safe to go through doubled up, so to get off I would shoot my not-so-small leg up toward the sky — groan like a bull moose just because it helped — and swing the leg around behind Dwaine’s back to dismount and, yeah, sometimes just roll off the back of the quad like a sack of potatoes.\nSometimes just me and at other times Hugh and I would walk through and around the dicey spot or up a slope to return to the waiting quads. That all took a while and, yes, it took a bit out of the walkers’ gas tanks. But it couldn’t be helped.\nI Don’t Need No Stinking Rubber Boots!\u003e I Don’t Need No Stinking Rubber Boots! # This section of the trail wasn’t without comic relief, which I supplied. As I was attempting to make my way through a nasty bog that had stopped up the lead quad for a bit, I took a wrong couple of steps, and sunk to my knees in mud. But there was still forward momentum so, suddenly I was on my knees falling forward into even more mud with both of my old black farmer-type rubber boots ripped off my feet, and impossibly stuck in the filthy ooze.\nIt took a two-armed heave to retrieve the boots from the massive suck of the mud hole. After that my feet were so soaked and my pants so filthy that getting muddy or getting my feet wet didn’t really matter anymore. Bonus!\nAnd for about three - or was it four or five? - more times during the afternoon, I lost a boot again after sinking into the muskeg ooze of mud hole that needed to be crossed on foot.\nIt was all part of the fun.\nGrizzly Ridge Tower\u003e Grizzly Ridge Tower # A group shot (minus me) at the tower. Nearer to the top of the ridge, both Hugh and I needed get off the quads to trudge to the top because the slope at that point made it just too dangerous to double up on the machines.\nWe made our way - oh, so slowly - to the top and then rested within sight of the tower, both of us too winded to march any further. Upon recovering, the tower was a such a cool sight. Its exterior looks weather-beaten but it’s been refurbished with new ladder-stairs so it’s very safe to climb.\nAfter retrieving the ultimate prize, Grizzly Ridge Tower Cache, hidden not too far away from the tower, we all eventually climbed the tower to take in the expansive view. There’s a lot of nature out there, plant, tree and animal and it it’s all part of a protected area, Grizzly Ridge Wildland Provincial Park.\n360 Photo From the Tower\u003e 360 Photo From the Tower # Grab the image with your mouse and twirl it around to see more.\nPost from RICOH THETA. - Spherical Image - RICOH THETA\nReturn Trip\u003e Return Trip # It was time to make the trip back. The nastiest section of the trek had to be travelled again and even though we’d already covered the ground between the tower and “gateway”, I was still continually impressed at what kind of nasty terrain these quads could go through.\nI’ve had precious little experience driving quads - some in my teens in Saskatchewan and then later in my late 30’s on the Arctic tundra in Nunavut - both relatively flat-terrain, fairly dry places. This terrain was not that, so I learned a lot and have far more respect for the drivers who can deftly maneuver the machines through hellishly nasty terrain.\nDwaine and Grant Brian and Hugh We returned by an alternate route, opting to take an east-west quad trail just north of the “gateway”. Dwaine had gotten a scouting report from his neighbour about this leg and so we thought it would be at least passable.\nThere were a couple of very nasty spots along here, no question, but all-in-all it was a good decision to return this way. It seemed like the “fight” of staying on the back of the quad actually seemed to pass more quickly now. Was I getting used to this or was I just getting numb?\nSoon, after getting through a very nasty spot and descending a steep hill, we reached an actual road, maintained by an oil / gas company operating the area.\nA real road. And we made real time.\nBack to the Staging Area\u003e Back to the Staging Area # On the way back to the staging area, we covered some of the same ground that three of us had travelled earlier that day to get Dwaine’s cache before our trek. It was cool actually recognizing familiar ground, a first for me during the trek through this new area to me.\nSince these were good roads we could pick up the pace, and soon we were back at staging area where high fives were in order.\nBut there was no time to rest. From the south a nasty rain squall was coming up on us quickly and before we could get out of there, nature congratulated us with some large cold rain splats. There was no big downpour, thank goodness, but that potential wetting of this road, which we had seen on the way in was greasy enough in some sections, made the guys load their quads with that much more haste.\nIt was such a great trip today and huge THANK YOU’s go to Dwaine and Bryan who man handled their quads with two bulky passengers for the 20 km round trip. It was the highlight of my outdoor experience this year, no question.\nEpilogue\u003e Epilogue # Believe it or don\u0026rsquo;t, these washed up good as new the next day! Three days later, I’m pretty sure I can still feel the indents in my butt from the metal rack that was my seat at the rear of the quad.\nBut I’m very sure that I’ll feel the impact of the experience of the trip for a much longer time to come.\nAnd for some comic relief, this is what my pants looked like after stopping along Canyon Creek road before arriving back in Slave Lake.\nAmazingly, after an overnight soak, they washed up looking like new the next day.\nPhoto Gallery\u003e Photo Gallery # The 20 km Route Today\u003e The 20 km Route Today # Click on the \u0026ldquo;Play\u0026rdquo; button in the middle of the map and then click the individual waypoints to travel to and view a picture at that spot.\n","date":"October 18, 2019","permalink":"/posts/quad-trek-to-grizzly-ridge-tower/","section":"","summary":"I\u0026rsquo;d been \u0026ldquo;map-dreaming\u0026rdquo; for literally years about making the trek to Grizzly Ridge Tower.

It struck me that this reminder (or was it closer to being a command?) was simply asking me to act outside of myself, to send a “prayer”, as I would frame it, good karma to others.\nThat set a kind of tone for my whole visit: I was being asked to at BE present and even to DO something during my visit to this place. I was no longer just a passive visitor.\nA second door opened to the church itself, and revealed five rows of pews all bathed in the summer sun radiating through the windows. The creaky floors, the Story \u0026amp; Clark organ and impressive stained-glass windows on the far wall gave me the feeling that I wasn’t in an everyday place. That’s exactly what a church is supposed to do: take you out of your “normal” world and transport you by being a physical space that reminds you of an “other” space, no matter how you conceive of that.\nThe inside of the church on a bright summer day. After finding the geocache, and admiring it, I signed the church register near the organ and couldn’t help lingering a while to admire the church itself.\nAs I write now, in a sense, I’m obeying the invocation in the vestibule: with these words, I’m offering a “prayer” to the place and the local people who continue to maintain it.\nSource: HeRMIS\nPhoto Gallery\u003e Photo Gallery # Location\u003e Location # ","date":"October 12, 2019","permalink":"/posts/st-laurence-anglican-church/","section":"","summary":"St. Laurence Anglican Church is located in the hamlet of Monitor, Alberta.

And I know for a fact that he\u0026rsquo;s even a member of a hiking club, so that makes him even more of an \u0026ldquo;official\u0026rdquo; hiker than I am.\nI made it a little hard on myself when I reached the large meadow at the end of the snow-packed trail. There was a fence slicing its way through the middle of the meadow that I\u0026rsquo;m quite sure I\u0026rsquo;d never seen before.\nI thought I had to go over that fence, and so I did. Later I realized that all snowmobile traffic goes around the fence not 100 meters from where I veered off the trail into deep snow to go over the fence.\nOh well, live and, hopefully, learn.\nThere was more deep snow and much post-holing after getting over the fence, but that didn\u0026rsquo;t last now.

Nope, that\u0026rsquo;s not for me, so I continued along the sled track to my cache, checked in it and continued around along the shoreline towards the second cache.\nLuckily there were sled tracks here too. These were a little softer than the others I\u0026rsquo;d been on, but still quite good and hard.\nAlong this stretch I saw human tracks and as I got closer to the cache I was 100% sure they were the cache owner\u0026rsquo;s tracks laid down as he was hiding the his cache. That made it quite easy to make my way straight to the cache, aside from the fact that I had a GPSr device in my hand.\nThe cache was found quickly.\nMy this trek was working out well. I still had lots of energy and was having fun making my way over ground that was new to me. On the way back, I was forced to cross a fence again, but after that blessed sled tracks kept me away from the deep snow. In fact, I followed those tracks to take the long way back to where I needed to go versus bee-lining the shortest route possible.\nSometimes the long way is the easiest way.\nThe trek back along the trail was uneventful, but I noted that with the temperature increasing, my tracks from the walk in were completely melted away.\nIt was indeed the first last of spring and the memories of that long, cold February will be erased too.\nPhoto Gallery\u003e Photo Gallery # ","date":"March 20, 2019","permalink":"/posts/hike-to-oliver-lake/","section":"","summary":"It seemed as if I was floating along the Ministik trails today.\nOf course I wasn\u0026rsquo;t.

For me it caused a sort of forced confinement during a holiday period when I\u0026rsquo;d normally be taking day trips, maybe taking some photos, maybe doing some geocaching. But when it\u0026rsquo;s -30 or -35 C with the wind chill it seems to me the sane thing to do is just hunker down and wait out the frigid cold.\nBy January 7, 2018 the temperature were far higher, near 0 C , and it was like a sweet release when I was finally able to wander out on a trip to east central Alberta, first, to find a couple of caches on Birch Lake Isle near Innisfree, AB and then continue on to Vermillion and finally Elk Point.\nAs I backed the car into its parking spot at the Birch Lake Isle campground gate, Bruce Cockburn\u0026rsquo;s All the Diamonds was playing on the car stereo system. Fate had choosen it from the thousands on an SD card packed with my favourite songs.\nAll the diamonds in this world\nThat mean anything to me\nAre conjured up by wind and sunlight\nSparkling on the sea\n-- All the Diamonds by Bruce Cockburn\nBut I had to leave the story it was weaving to go weave my own by walking across the frozen lake bed to Birch Lake Isle.\nMy footprints on the windswept snow on the ice. After gathering what I needed - GPS receiver, hiking pole, camera, micro-spikes in case I needed them on the ice, two touques and gloves - I set out through the campground and soon began walking on the snow-crusted ice.\nThe 11 am sun was beating down on crusty, windswept snow on the lake bed and with the song still wafting through my consciousness there was a strong moment of synchronicity: as I walked the sunshine glinted off the lake snow conjuring up a billion sparkling diamonds around me.\nThe short definition of synchronicity is \u0026ldquo;meaningful coincidence\u0026rdquo;. That song prefacing this sparkling moment that seemed to be welcoming me to a new reality was truly meaningful to me. I was no longer cooped-up in the house, the world of manmade things. Now I was experiencing a sparkling moment of beauty as I embarked on a journey into nature.\nAnd a journey it was. After finding the first cache, I circled the island on the north side, which ended up making things harder on myself than they needed to be. The snow that built up around the shoreline sometimes held my weight, but most of the time I was post-holing through it. That saps the energy.\nOn the westmost end of the island I noticed a series of game-trail switchbacks up the steepest end of the island. I put on my microspikes and once I got started they were like a magic wand, allowing me to follow the snow-packed icy trail in zig zag legs up the side and to the top.\nAfter spending some time taking a waypoint for the cache (it was an earthcache - there\u0026rsquo;s no physical container to find) and taking some pictures, I made my way down the established trail on the south side of the island, across the ice again to meet my tracks in and back to the car.\nIt was a fun mini-adventure and a worthy release from the cage December\u0026rsquo;s weather had imposed on me and my mind.\nMy Track Log Today\u003e My Track Log Today # See full screen\n","date":"January 13, 2018","permalink":"/posts/all-the-diamonds-in-this-world/","section":"","summary":"A winter walk over lake ice to Birch Lake Isle near Innisfree, Alberta.","title":"All the Diamonds in This World"},{"content":"A small church was built on this site in 1907 and then replaced by the current building, built in 1934-35.

Early settlers in the area built a small chapel here in 1904, but this burned to the ground while the present church was being built in 1924. The belfry beside the church was constructed in 1938.\nFor the past number of years the church has been used only for annual services.\nBut the church gradually must have fallen into disrepair and “In 2013, an engineering report stated the foundation was unstable and it could cost up to $400,000 to repair it.” ( Source)\nIn 2013, a meeting was held to decide on the church’s fate and instead of proceeding with a controlled burn of the building, with the local funding raising and the help of local businesses, it was decided save the structure and move the church to a new foundation. That’s what I was seeing today: the result of a move that was completed in December, 2016.\nAnd as I was researching the church, I found some evidence on my own computer: photos I’d taken of the church back in 2008 show that I’d been here before to find a geocache. One photo shows the church in its original spot with the belfry close by. So really, I should have been able to recognize the church had been moved, but the memory of a previous visit had already faded away.\nMy July, 2008 photo (top cross cut off and all) shows the church in its orginal spot, fairly close to the belfry. At first glance, the money, time and energy being spent now to save a structure that will be very rarely used as a church and seldom used by the community doesn’t make practical sense. But, there’s another, stronger urge at play here. No different from my forgetting, the local population recognizes that simply letting the church disintegrate to nothing means the memory of the church and its place in the lives of their ancestors will simply fade away as well.\nThis church provided a place that helped give their forebears some sense meaning during their lives. In fact, many of those people are buried in the adjoining cemetery. In a sense, erasing the building is the beginning of the erasing of all memory of their existence.\nIn the long run, erasure is inevitable. Make no mistake about that. But the will to fight against it is part of what makes us alive. So I can’t help but think the core meaning of a Dylan Thomas poem infuses the community’s current transfiguration of the church building:\nDo not go gentle into that good night, …\nRage, rage against the dying of the light.\n-Dylan Thomas\nPhotos\u003e Photos # Sources\u003e Sources # Source: “Lamont County’s Self-Guided Church Tours” booklet.

There the church played a large role in their lives and once settled in this area of Canada, some were attending Fridhem Lutheran Church, about 10 miles away. Many, however, felt the need for a local church closer to home so that families could attend.\nThe church website details the options considered for the church’s location, and the political fallout from the choice, but after all this work began on the church at the present location in 1912. The work was finished the next year, an organ purchased in Winnipeg (for $114.30) and over the next 5 years money was raised to pay for internal furnishings like the altar, lectern, and pews. Years later, money was raised for a church bell purchased for $221.47 from the St. Louis Bell Foundry in St. Louis, Missouri.\nWilhelmina Evangelical Lutheran Church near Hay Lakes, AB The church website goes on to provide many more details about additional changes and enhancements to the church and using the date of the first initial meeting regarding the building of a church in November, 1908, the endeavour’s centennial was commemorated in 2008.

That\u0026rsquo;s an easy one, right? Well, maybe not.\nSometimes, not even the simple, core conceptions you have about the world around you are true and things don\u0026rsquo;t always act like they \u0026ldquo;should\u0026rdquo; according to the conceptional mould you\u0026rsquo;ve been forming about the world around you since birth.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s why visiting the \u0026ldquo;Crooked Trees” (or \u0026ldquo;Crooked Bush” depending on what sign you read) is so interesting. Here are aspen trees that don\u0026rsquo;t simply grow vertically. Instead they seem to grow UP and then sideways, UP again, sideways again, and so on.\nNoticed as early as the 1940’s, this small stand of trees is located approximately 16 km north of Speers, Saskatchewan at N52° 52.266\u0026rsquo; W107° 32.229’ and is bounded by a road, so they’re not likely to break out of their small plot any time soon.\nTrees across the road outside this little plot of land seem perfectly normal so since they were noticed people have speculated about why what these trees act so differently. Was it UFO’s, meteorites, maybe radioactive soil?\nAs an experiment, parts of the trees were propagated in Manitoba. Dr. Bill Remphrey’s archived web page points out that\nWhen the trees are vegetatively propagated and grown in sites in Manitoba, the crookedness is retained, and it is likely that the crooked trait stems from a genetic mutation.\nIn essence, because the trait can be propagated, it has little to do with location or soil factors. And Dr. Remphrey notes on the same page that the specific genetic mutation probably has to do with a lack of strength of the tree shoots at critical times during its growth may be the reason.\nThat sounds reasonable to me.\nPhoto Gallery\u003e Photo Gallery # Additional Links\u003e Additional Links # Tourism Saskatchewan’s page\nWikipedia’s “Crooked Trees” page\nWant to visit the Crooked Trees?\u003e Want to visit the Crooked Trees? # If you’re a geocacher, you can simply route yourself to https://coord.info/GC166TF.\nIf not, use these coordinates to get there using an automotive GPS device:\nFirst get to this corner at N52° 43.535\u0026rsquo; W107° 34.574\u0026rsquo;(shown below) and turn north at this intersection (notice the sign pointing the way) Then turn right (east) at N52° 52.274\u0026rsquo; W107° 34.573\u0026rsquo; and drive the approximately 2km to the site.

The weather was excellent and the only worry was getting too much sun, so I slathered on sun screen (no mosquito repellant needed, thank goodness - the noon sun and strong winds kept them at home I think).\nThis was a really unique ridge to walk along.

A couple of significant dumps of snow during the past few weeks seemed to bring us that mid-winter, snow and cold everywhere feeling in what seemed like a blink of an eye.\nMy reaction to all that was to snap into hibernation mode, something I’d expect to happen in February, not November or December. Because of that I really hadn’t ventured out on any substantial weekend hikes yet this winter season.\nThis weekend I was determined to snap out of hibernation and get out on some trail, somewhere. The Ministik Bird Sanctuary is always a good choice because there are options for long, or short hikes and you never really know what you’re getting yourself into when you tackle one of them: trails might be frequented by snowmobiles, skiers or… no one.\nI started out from what I call “Ministik South Parking” near Mandy Lake and was aiming to explore a branch trail where a couple of geocaches have been hidden for years and where I hid one recently. I was boldly going where I hadn’t gone before.\nAlthough my snowshoes where in the back seat when I started out, I decided to tackle the trail without them. I do find them a bit cumbersome and it’s always a trade off between how much I’m going to have to fight with them as opposed to how much they’ll help me navigate through the snow. Today, for the first leg of the trail anyway, I really doubted my decision to leave them off: there was no trail to speak of, only a consistent deer track, so the trail breaking really put my heart rate up for the first half hour or so.\nOnce I reached the junction of the main trail and the side trail I wanted to explore I was so grateful to find that a snowmobile had traveled the trail in the not too distant past. While following the side trail, the going was tough in sections, but the sled track helped a lot, making it easier to make good time down the trail and lose the energy-sapping “drunken sailor” method of walking that one gets into while slipping and sliding through soft snow.\nSoon I was in what seemed like new territory. For me that’s where the fun starts because the senses start to get a workout, something they don’t always get in the city. Now that might sound strange: out in the “middle of nowhere” the senses get more of a workout than they would on a city street?\nI’ve just been reading a photography book where the author, Ben Long, talks about “seeing” the world around us. The brain, out of necessity, filters out a very large amount of what we see around us; most times we’re in familiar territory and the data we bring in isn’t a threat or isn’t relevant so it’s filtered so that we can concentrate on what’s at hand, like not hitting other cars or people while driving, for example. He notes that when traveling to new, unfamiliar places, a person\u0026rsquo;s senses tend to perk up so that suddenly rich details seem to pop out of what would be common, everyday experience for the locals. In new and different surroundings, so much of what is around us isn\u0026rsquo;t \u0026ldquo;common\u0026rdquo; anymore, so the brain doesn’t have the experience of knowing what is safe to filter out. The scenes in front of us seem richer with detail, more alive and more interesting because we\u0026rsquo;re evaluating more of the details we\u0026rsquo;re experiencing.\nOne aspect of this is that the animal part of our natures are awakened and we\u0026rsquo;re a little more aware of the threat of dangers. In unfamiliar territory, the brain hasn\u0026rsquo;t learned what is a threat and what isn\u0026rsquo;t. I find that the awareness that danger could be lurking, maybe around the next bend in the trail is ever present when I\u0026rsquo;m on new trails in the wild. It’s not a fear, or dread by any means, but when I’m in places that are new to me, the awareness of possible danger is definitely present.\nThis maybe explains why I was suddenly constantly aware of the noises in the thickets around me and constantly scanning the trail ahead for other creatures. For me, this is part of the allure of exploring new places. There’s the experience new places, but there’s the constant feeling that danger could be lurking, and puts me just a little bit on edge, providing a bit of thrill as new trails are traveled.I had a cache container with me ready to hide somewhere along the trail today, and once I made it to a clearing absolutely packed with cattails, I thought I’d hide the cache and call it “Cattail Cocktail Party”; that’s just what the mass of swaying cattails looked like: a crowd mingling at a party. I couldn’t find a good spot though and had no way to simply hang the cache in a tree, so I gave up on the idea of hiding one today.\nOnce I’d made it to a waypoint I’d called “EastWestCutline”, sure enough there was a definite cut line that would have taken me to new places to the east, but it was fenced off and not knowing the area well, nor where the southern boundary of the sanctuary really was, I decided to backtrack instead of exploring it. I see now that the cutline is well within the sanctuary boundary so I could have made my way along the cut line without any guilt. Some day that will happen.\nAfter considering simply returning along the path and calling it day, I decided I had more gas in the energy tank and decided to follow a well-worn snowmobile track leading east. I had plenty of waypoints loaded that would keep me from wandering too far east and perhaps making it tough to get back to the parking spot, so I felt confident I could bail off of this eastbound track anytime. In the end the track took me in a very nice loop around to the old abandoned cabin on shoreline of Mandy Lake.\nThis winding leg of the trip offered up a lot of open expanses that in warm weather would be boggy or full of water, making them difficult to reach in summer. These were prime spots to capture with the sweep panorama feature on my camera, so I ended up with far more panos today than usual.\nIt was a fun trek. The snowmobile packed trail made for relatively easy going and finding traffic signs for snowmobiles in what I considered to be deep in the bush was pretty amusing.\nIn the end I found myself walking across Mandy Lake itself; if a sled and driver had made it across, I thought I was safe enough to venture there too.\nI stopped for a rest and bite to eat at the shelter near the old cabin. That was a welcome break, but I found that after sitting around and then standing still to take a few pictures, I’d become quite chilled. The warmth that comes from moving along the trail wasn’t being generated and the sweaty layers under my jacket were starting to cool down my core in an uncomfortable way.\nI had to get moving again so I gladly donned my pack and made my way back towards the parking spot along what is familiar trail in warmer seasons. A snowmobile had traveled this way in the past as well, although the track was quite old, so I was happy again to mostly be walking on the snow instead of ploughing through it. The movement helped though, and very slowly I warmed up again.\nAfter a few full stops for rest along the trail – my legs, especially my calves, were really feeling the effects of this snow trudge by this time – I finally spied the gate near the parking spot again, and soon enough my parked car too.\nIt was a fun trek to new places today. I look forward to trying to follow a similar path in warmer weather and exploring new trails I only spied for the first time along today’s walk.\nMy Track Log\u003e My Track Log # See full screen\n","date":"December 16, 2012","permalink":"/posts/ministik-south-recon-hike/","section":"","summary":"This recon hike was made and the blog post written early in my explorations of the Ministik Bird Sanctuary.

I knew that. But knowing is only a mental concept until you actually do it. It still surprises me that this hike added up to 22 km and took me 5 hrs twenty minutes to do, 4 hrs moving, and 1 hour and 20 minutes stopped either resting, taking pictures or checking on others\u0026rsquo; caches.\nMy goal as I started out from the Islet Lake Staging Area in Blackfoot on a holiday (for me) Monday was two caches hidden by Kickbuttedmonton an Edmonton cacher who usually works in the word “Cigar” into his cache titles because, well, he likes cigars I guess! The first cache was in relatively easy walking distance, but the second one, well that one wasn\u0026rsquo;t. It was hidden at the northernmost edge of Blackfoot where the recreational area borders Elk Island National Park. It was going to be a long walk to that one.\nA November 15 without snow; that was a treat. All the same, the cool winds of November blowing today were like the “advance team” for an old man winter who was certainly not far behind. Even though I\u0026rsquo;d pretty much just returned from a hiking trip in Kananaskis two days ago, I knew I had to go for these caches before the snow came wafting down. Otherwise those pesky cache symbols – and not smilies (what the map shows once you\u0026rsquo;ve logged a cache as found) – would be staring me in the face the entire winter. I just couldn\u0026rsquo;t have that! :-)\nI started out on the hike feeling strong and had a nice walking rhythm early. The Islet Lake trails are really interesting since one starts beside a beautiful lake dotted with little islands. I\u0026rsquo;ve been to this area enough to say I\u0026rsquo;ve been able to witness the same ground with quite a few different characters: foggy, sunny and now, well, November-y.\nI quickly made my way to the first cache which was hidden at one of the many huts placed strategically throughout the rec area. After the making the find, I noticed that the logbook, an official geocaching logbook ordered from the website, was actually a German version. This prompted me to try to dredge up my German from years past and write part of my log in German. It was fun and frustrating at the same time, since I had to strain a bit to remember spelling (which in German is usually very easy – unlike English, in German, if you can say it, you can spell it – that\u0026rsquo;s so darn practical and logical!).\nPush Lake Shelter After re-hiding the cache, I steeled myself for the long, long next phase to the second cache. The trail took me to Push Lake Shelter where I was thankful to make use of the facilities and took a few pics. Then I scaled a couple of fences and was on my way north on a road called N.U.L. North. I guess I must be losing my Sask. roots a bit because walking that long straight, featureless road became a tad boring.\nI was able to break the monotony by looking in on a cache called “Highest Point” because, not coincidentally, this spot is the highest point of elevation in Blackfoot. I didn\u0026rsquo;t have the coordinates to the cache and was just going on memory of the time I first found the cache with my friend Amy on Nov. 10, 2007 a little more than 3 years ago. Well after rolling commando style under the fence, I walked over to where I thought it was, experienced a strong bout of deja vu and literally found it in 20 seconds. The ammo box looked fine the way it was, so I didn\u0026rsquo;t open it, just put another nearby log over top to keep it snug for the winter months.\nThe final stretch of road to the \u0026quot;crossroads\u0026quot; intersection. The next stop was another cache I\u0026rsquo;d found before, another by Kickbuttedmonton. This one wasn\u0026rsquo;t so healthy and I spent some time fixing it up, finding some better cover for it and adding some paper from a notebook I was carrying because the logbook seemed to have mysteriously disappeared. Now that I think about, that probably made up a good 20 minutes of my “stopped time” noted above.\nThe road\u0026rsquo;s gummy soil was sticking to my shoes in the intermittent spitting rain (mixed with at least a few snowflakes) so I was glad to dip onto Wapiti trail for the rest of the walk to the second cache. That trail is used by equestrians so it too was worked up and sticky in places, but on the whole was a nice change from the long, straight road.\nAlong this leg I was really struck with the amount of beaver activity in the area. I had chuckle when I saw a completely chewed tree which normally would have been a fallen trophy for the beaver, but had only fallen into the branches of its neighbour which were still holding it up. I could just see the beaver having to call back the contractor on that one!\nAt another spot beaver had fallen a huge tree which was partly obstructing the trail. I took some pictures and had fun composing captions for them. There\u0026rsquo;s time to think about these kinds of things during a long, long hike.\nI finally made it to the cache site and made the find pretty quickly; it wasn\u0026rsquo;t meant to be a hard hide. Then I just sat and ate a hiking power bar and drank a good bit of water. Looking at my GPSr, I saw I\u0026rsquo;d just walked 11 km to get here. Now I had to get back! I had joked in the cache log that I\u0026rsquo;d just wait for the helicopter I\u0026rsquo;d ordered, but the hard truth was that I had to walk all the way back now.\nI decided to take what looked like a longer but much more scenic route back, mostly along trails I\u0026rsquo;d walked before during past hikes. I took Wapiti back to Winter trail and followed that for 2.4 km until it met up with Lost Lake trail which is a long, long trail that spans a good part of the rec area. Whenever I\u0026rsquo;d get to a trail intersection, I would feel I\u0026rsquo;d accomplished something, smile and then continue on, trying to keep a good pace because the clouded sky was losing the light fast.\nOn the way along Lost Lake trail I checked in on one of my own caches, one which has been reported as being found right out in the open a few times: no doubt due to some frisky coyotes using it as a play toy. On this my first maintenance visit to the cache, I found it snugly hidden away by some conscientious finders and I\u0026rsquo;m thankful that they hid it so well.\nOne of the \u0026quot;islets\u0026quot; at Islet Lake. I took Push Lake trail on last leg back to Islet Lake and by this time I really could feel that my little toe of my right foot was hurting. Later I found a small blister on it, but since that was the only real indication on my feet of such a log walk, I really don\u0026rsquo;t have too much to complain about.\nBlackfoot staging areas all have signs at 400 meters away from the trailhead which tell seasonal hunters there\u0026rsquo;s no discharging any closer to the staging area parking. After such a long walk, to a non-hunter like me, seeing those sign is like a gift from heaven. It means I\u0026rsquo;m close to being able to rest and recuperate. As I walked by the sign I smiled a broad smile and was actually quite proud I\u0026rsquo;d been able to keep up the pace on leg after leg of this hike and return tired, sure, but pretty much unscathed from the trek.\nI honestly think it\u0026rsquo;s such a privilege to be able to walk safely, in solitude in such naturally wild places.\n","date":"November 15, 2010","permalink":"/posts/blackfoot-islet-lake-hike/","section":"","summary":"A hike to inner depths of the Cooking Lake - Blackfoot Provincial Recreation Area.

I remember a co-worker at MacEwan mentioning he\u0026rsquo;d gone hiking with a buddy and that they\u0026rsquo;d had a lot of trouble finding the trailhead. Then a year or so later I happened to be reading the logs of geocaches I\u0026rsquo;d like to do someday and saw the cache owner had a picture of a log book signed by \u0026ldquo;non-cachers\u0026rdquo; - none other than my MacEwan co-worker and his buddy. So this is where they\u0026rsquo;d gone. I wanted to go too!\nThe context of the climb up Folding Mountain. I had another more selfish reason for wanting to do the hike up Folding Mountain: there were two caches with the same Difficulty / Terrain rating, a combination I needed to fill my \u0026ldquo;Difficulty / Terrain\u0026rdquo; matrix, a goal I\u0026rsquo;d been working on since Dec. 09. I needed either of those caches to fill that spot on my chart.\nThe trailhead sign After spending the night in Hinton, I arrived at about 8:00 am the parking spot near the trailhead (both of which I\u0026rsquo;d scouted out the day before while caching in the area). Then the long, hard slog up the first section trail began. The UP was relentless, with an early start I knew I had lots to time to get as far as I could during the day and get back again. The first cache I found along trail was named HTEG Micro (\u0026ldquo;Half the Elevation Gained\u0026rdquo;). I wrote in the find log afterward that I\u0026rsquo;d mentally renamed this cache AATLJG (Almost All The Leg Juice Gone). But once I\u0026rsquo;d gotten there and found that well camo\u0026rsquo;d cache, there was still elevation but somehow it didn\u0026rsquo;t seem so bad.\nOnce I made my way up a little more, I could start to see south across Highway 16 to the Athabasca River. At this point the views were filled with dark clouds and a light mist was falling, making me worried that if the weather worsened I\u0026rsquo;d have to retreat and try this ascent another day. Luckily, as the day wore on, the bad weather simply blew past and left vegetation green and glistening with water in the sunlight.\nA resting spot on the way up It was a refreshing sight, but the problem was the water on the bushes and grasses along the trail was splashing onto my legs, running down through my socks and actually filling my boots with water. If there was ever a time for gaiters, this was it, but alas I didn\u0026rsquo;t have any with me. By the time I\u0026rsquo;d found a cache that required me to project a waypoint from a certain set of rocks \u0026ndash; and it took me BACK along the trail I\u0026rsquo;d just hiked and UP for little bit again \u0026ndash; I was ready to dump the water from my boots and wring out my socks. From then on, I could walk properly without squishing at every step.\nGradually, I made my way to find six of the seven caches along the way, including the two that had the D/T combination I needed. Then came the summit and as I neared it, well, it looked foreboding. From here on, I think I\u0026rsquo;ll just let what I wrote in the online log for the summit cache tell the story:\nThe summit in sight The summit. There it sits in its almost naked grandeur. I\u0026rsquo;d seen the various log pictures, and played the climbing movie in my brain beforehand, but, as usual, the actual experience was different than the movies. The actual climbing to the summit was a real challenge for me and I\u0026rsquo;m proud of myself for having done it. When one gets closer and closer, the quiet summit gets a little more intimidating with each step toward it, until you kind of hurt your neck because of the extreme angle while peering up as you find the trail on the way up. Little mantras did help me on the way though, like (since I\u0026rsquo;d gotten a fairly early start) “I\u0026rsquo;ve got all day”; “ One step at a time” was useful, but actually there was more like 10m between my rest breaks; and also popular, just so I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t have to look the thing in the face anymore, was “Don\u0026rsquo;t look up!\nWhen I reached the top (Halleluiah!), and suddenly spied the summit cairn, I only had the energy to let out two sounds: “Ha – Ha”; that was all I had the energy for, and then I had to have a rest, at least for a few minutes.\nAfter that, not paying any attention to my GPSr at this point, I immediately spied a container nestled in the rocks of the summit cairn. Given the cache name, I just assumed these were the goods. After uncovering and opening the plastic container, I found only a large hollowed out book with some paper inside. The only signatures were from what looked like a church (?) group of I guessed were mostly teenagers (?) and dated August 5, 2010, just five days ago. My sleuthing powers were at their peak when I said out loud, “This is not a geocache!” They don\u0026rsquo;t call me the Master of the Obvious for nothing! After fetching my GPSr I realized the cache was a little ways away and made my way over to make a quick find in the well-chosen spot and it was a thrill to find the cache as a kind of tangible symbol to acknowledge the hard work it had taken to get to the summit.\nAfter re-hiding the cache best I could in the same way I\u0026rsquo;d found it, I had lunch and explored the area and took in the 360 degree views. What a great spot, with so much character. To the west in the foreground it looks hard and sharp, but to the south it looks, in this season anyway, soft, with subtle green slopes. To the east simply vast, with views of the Hinton area and beyond. I lingered for quite a while, and didn\u0026rsquo;t want to leave, so just continued to take in the view and take pictures. Making my way down was faster, but required much more focus than ascending. I\u0026rsquo;d been happy to be at the top, but now it was also comforting to make my way to what seemed like solid ground on the trail below.\nI made my way more along the trail more quickly, of course, because elevation wasn\u0026rsquo;t a factor, but the toes really did hurt quite a bit once I finally reached the highway and heard what seemed like the sweet sounds of cars whizzing by to and from Jasper.\nCivilization again, now with a fresh glow of accomplishment to make it seem better.\nPhoto Gallery\u003e Photo Gallery # My Track Log\u003e My Track Log # See full screen\n","date":"August 10, 2010","permalink":"/posts/climb-to-the-summit-of-folding-mountain/","section":"","summary":"A made the memorable climb to the summit of Folding Mountain mid-August, 2010.","title":"Climb to the Summit of Folding Mountain"},{"content":" Along the way on the logging road. I drove to Kananaskis from Calgary in the morning and just after 8:30 was parked and on the way towards the summit of Lusk Creek Ridge, my main goal for the day. At this point in the hike, I really didn’t know what I was getting myself into and my plans were grand: to nab five geocaches on the ridge during the day. If you read on you’ll see why that once I started up the ridge and found out how strenuous this off trail hiking can be, my lofty goals quickly shrunk to getting ONE cache if I could successfully stay alive to manage it. In the end I managed to get two caches and felt proud and thoroughly satisfied to have accomplished that.\nOver a month or so before I arrived that morning I\u0026rsquo;d had such a great time reading the logs of all the caches along Lusk Creek Ridge. I saw there are a select few cachers who consistently showed up in the logs and who are obviously in to challenging themselves with hikes and climbs to seldom-reached spots. Just reading their logs and seeing that they had climbed this ridge time after time from different access points made me admire their tenacity and their energy!\nWhen I reached the first waypoint that I’d named \u0026ldquo;Head UP\u0026rdquo; on my GPS receiver, I saw what looked like an almost a vertical path UP. I just said, out loud, \u0026ldquo;He can\u0026rsquo;t mean I\u0026rsquo;m supposed to go up there\u0026rdquo;. I guess I just couldn’t believe and ended up skirting that spot to try another route further along and to this day I’m not sure if that was a wise decision.\nThe route I’d elected to try to access the ridge was the not usual one used by most others to reach the top of the ridge. But this route started out on a logging road, a more or less flat trail to follow: something that I, an original native of Saskatchewan could relate to. But that relatively familiar and flat terrain would soon be a fond memory.\n![My first glimpse of the \u0026ldquo;tree soup\u0026rdquo; logged out area.](Kananaskis-Trips-025.jpg \u0026ldquo;My first glimpse of the \u0026ldquo;tree soup\u0026rdquo; logged out area.\u0026rdquo;)\nInstead of the direct route up, I took kind of a right flank on the first two waypoints I’d planned to head for, all supplied by a cacher, Sleepy_Hollow, who recommend the route over the one usually used to get to the top. I actually got close to Sleepy Hollow\u0026rsquo;s third waypoint, but that was a while later. Making this flank move just seemed a little more \u0026ldquo;sane\u0026rdquo; at the time, but of course anyone who has experience this kind of climb will know that \u0026ldquo;sane\u0026rdquo; is just a relative, and actually pretty meaningless, concept. In short, it was just me muddling through the situation, best I could.\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s this? A human is barging right through our living room. I made my way up slowly, oh, so slowly with frequent stops. On the way, unfortunately, I managed to barge right into the living room of couple of jumpers. They retreated and stood watching me for a while and I could just hear them saying, \u0026ldquo;Like, he\u0026rsquo;s not coming up any further is he?\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Of course not!\u0026rdquo; was the reply, \u0026ldquo;Look at him! He\u0026rsquo;s only using two legs and those silly pole things.\u0026rdquo; When I did manage to move upward again, they literally pranced four hooves at time like they do UP the nasty slope away from me like it was nothing, leaving me behind panting and in awe of their energy and speed.\nAt little later, I had to climb a couple of ledges to continue up. I wasn\u0026rsquo;t entirely happy with that because it\u0026rsquo;s just not something I\u0026rsquo;m used to doing, but it had to happen. And you know, speaking as a relative newbie at this \u0026ldquo;off trail\u0026rdquo; hiking thing, I think that\u0026rsquo;s where the allure is in doing this kind of thing: you meet situations where you just do what has to be done, even if it\u0026rsquo;s a hard thing to be done. All theorizing stops. At first thinking helps out a to be sure, but soon it stops and then the doing starts. And what you\u0026rsquo;re doing becomes ALL you\u0026rsquo;re doing. I know that kind of attention to the moment was essential for me while climbing up those small ledges.\nGradually, what I was calling \u0026ldquo;The Cliffs of Insanity\u0026rdquo; (a la \u0026ldquo;Princess Bride\u0026rdquo;) changed into actual tree cover and the climb became much more manageable. For instance, I didn\u0026rsquo;t have to walk at a 45 degree angle ALL the time, only sometimes. A little later, open areas were welcomed too because it was such a luxury to actually walk in a straight line to a destination as opposed to making my way around deadfall and minor rock cliffs.\nHighway 68 below (that\u0026rsquo;s where I parked!) and Barrier Lake in the background Still, ever so slowly, I made my way to the summit, , and when I reached the top and glimpsed the metal of cache container, a loud \u0026ldquo;YES\u0026rdquo; of triumph was heard, well, by no one but me. I would have done a happy dance had I had the energy and I guess I would have pumped my fist when I said, \u0026ldquo;YES!\u0026rdquo;, but again, no energy.\nWhat a great way to celebrate Canada Day!! July 1, 2010 These were my first few hours ever in Kananaskis and let me tell you the views in every direction were truly breath taking. I can\u0026rsquo;t name any of the other peaks in the area as I see done in the logs of others who know the area so much better, but I honestly appreciated the power and grandeur of this place.\nI admire those who have managed to make their way to the cache at the summit; I can\u0026rsquo;t imagine doing it in the snow as many have done. What I admire is that the names in this cache log are also in the logs of many if not all the other caches on the Lusk Creek Ridge. That means that getting here wasn\u0026rsquo;t merely a \u0026ldquo;one-off\u0026rdquo;, that they undertook this challenging trek and then some other morning got up and did it again, and again some other morning…. That\u0026rsquo;s what I admire.\nAfter taking a bunch of pictures, resting and having a bite to eat, I contemplated going for few cache south of this spot and on to another summit to the south. But I knew my energy just wasn’t there that day to do all that. What’s more I would have had to go DOWN and then UP again in order to get where I was going. Psychologically, I just didn’t think I could do it.\nSprays of lichen in a river of wood. Instead made my way over to another cache and, thankfully, I was going down now, so the trek didn’t seem as difficult by far. Mercifully, the path to this cache was along a ridge, complete with a game trail to walk along for most of the way. It was absolute luxury compared to the hike up to the summit. I made my way to the cache and with the help of the hint made the find quickly.\nThe view from nearby was awesome. It gave me a clear view of the road I’d taken to get to my parking spot a few hours before. I honestly felt I was being spoiled with the wonderful views during my first few hours in Kananaskis. As I write this I know there is much, much more to see in the great area.\nAll I needed now is to make my way down to logging road to where I’d started. This part of the hike was uneventful until I reached the sheer slope that I’d avoided at the beginning of the climb up. I swear, on the whole going down that slope hurt almost as much as the climb up. The downward slope was such that my toes were always scrunched into the front of my boots and of course I had to go down so there was no let up in this. Strange to say, but it was hard climb down because of the toe pain, not the lung pain and exhaustion I’d felt on the way up.\nEventually, however, I was able to get down to level ground again and make my back along the logging road to the car.\nIt was a challenging, memorable and somehow magical trek to the top of Lusk Creek Ridge and back. Since it was my first experience ever in Kananaskis, I don’t think I’ll ever forget the experience.\nMy Track Log\u003e My Track Log # See full screen\n","date":"July 1, 2010","permalink":"/posts/hike-to-lusk-creek-ridge-central-summit/","section":"","summary":"It was my first ever visit to Kananaskis where I made the very memorable off-trail climb to the central summit along Lusk Creek Ridge.

This was the first time either of us had visited Grande Cache and little did we know we just happened to choose one of the more challenging trails in the area.\nThe sign near the trailhead - do the math, it\u0026rsquo;s a 1000m gain in elevation. After checking out the hiking possibilities at the Information Centre we decided on Mt. Stearn. To be honest, neither of us knew what we were getting ourselves into. We understand the distance involved and felt comfortable with that, but speaking for myself anyway, I had no conception of the elevation gain involved, about 1175 m (3854 ft) from the trailhead to the summit. It was a about a 16.6 km hike for me (I went a couple of extra kms near the summit while I looked for a geocache which I didn’t find - and don’t feel bad at ALL about giving up on it).\nOn the way up we were passed by a couple of groups of equestrians, one of whom said, \u0026ldquo;Boy, you guys must be in shape\u0026rdquo;. I forget what was actually said out loud in response to that - and there\u0026rsquo;s a good chance we were just to tired to respond at all \u0026ndash; but I know I was thinking, \u0026ldquo;Boy, am I ever NOT in shape, but I\u0026rsquo;m going to do this anyway\u0026rdquo;.\nWe agreed at the end of the hike that there was new psychological constant equation in life: 1200 m elevation gain = HELL. (Well, when you are in the physical shape we were in at the time, that is.)\nWe were both very proud to have finished this hike. It was a real accomplishment. In a masochistic kind of way, this hike awakened a goal: to climb all of the Bronze peaks in the local “Passport to the Peaks: program\nB1 Grande Mountain 6520\u0026rsquo; (completed July 26, 2009)\nB2 Flood Mountain 6000\u0026rsquo; (completed July 1, 2009)\nB3 Mount Louie 6075\u0026rsquo; (completed June 13, 2009)\nB4 Mount Stearn 6625\u0026rsquo; (almost made it once on this hike, but we weren\u0026rsquo;t aware of the \u0026ldquo;Passport to the Peaks\u0026rdquo; program when we did this hike; still have to do it.

Stearn near Grande Cache"},{"content":"The second day of my excursions to the Cooking Lake – Blackfoot Recreational Area was on Sunday, November 4, 2007. This was good day. The first significant snowfall of the season had fallen over night, so the ground was blanketed by fresh snow. It’s funny how that is a treat, even after having lived though what seems like countless winters of waist deep snow.\nI got out to the same place I’d just left the afternoon before, (if you’ve read the November 3 account you’ll know I missed ONE cache completely the day before and I was determined to go find it).\nBut this day had a completely different feel to it.\nThe fresh snow covered the trail and mine were the first human steps on the path that morning. It was fun coming up on animal trails, trying to figure out what kind of animal it was and then seeing the trail disappear into the bush. This made the trip to that one cache a real treat. Once I got close, I dipped into the bush to find the cache and not 15 seconds later a couple of women jogged by on the trail, doing a morning run. They probably wondered what happened to the big human tracks that disappeared into the bush.\nI distinctly remember finding this cache. The GPSr has a margin of error of about 10 ft at the best of times. So if the person who hid the cache wasn’t very accurate with coordinates and you are about 10 feet off yourself, you know you could be looking within at least a 20 feet radius for this container\u0026hellip;.under a blanket of snow. Well, isn’t this special, you say to yourself. Where to start?\nI stood in one spot, put my gloves back on ready to start swishing the snow in the area, but before I started the brain kicked in and my eye started to look for cache-worthy spots. The first such spot was right beside my foot, so I bent down to move a piece of bark and VOILA, a cache was revealed! I laughed out loud. After that initial feeling of hopelessness and discouragement, I hadn’t moved a muscle and there was the cache, a cylindrical plastic container just as advertised in the description. That was special. :-)\nI had done my duty, found the one cache, so I made my way back to the car and drove around to the southern part of the Cooking Lake - Blackfoot Rec. Area looking for a backdoor entrance. The cache owner had given parking coordinates to this back door, but my keen spidey directional sense managed to miss the turn off to the parking spot the first try. I found it eventually, parked and made my way down a really neat corridor of trees, again making the only human prints that morning.\nA neat corridor to follow from the parking spot. This entire walk this morning was certainly shorter than the day before, and there weren’t the same number of caches to be found, but there was something almost spiritual about the experience. I honestly felt cleansed as I walked down the narrow trail. The new snow definitely contributed to this feeling, but I think it was the remoteness of the area as well.\nThe animal track activity had certainly increased, possibility because of the proximity of the lake. And the lake itself seemed to be in a strange state: half rippling and half frozen. The lake was deciding what it was going to become and in a sense so was I.\nI walked down the little trail, crossing a beaver damn that I’d seen in the log pictures of others, passed a little hut which seemed to used very little, and on to the cache area which promised to be on a point on the lake. The description suggested following blue diamond ski markers to the cache area, which I did, all the time wondering how anyone could ski on this very hilly terrain (Sask. roots showing there).\nThe path took me up an incline and finally to the tip of the point with a fairly sharp drop to the shoreline. Well, walking down that incline seems a bit hairy, so I just used my brains, so to speak, sat down and skidded to the shore on my bum. It worked pretty well.\nThe log book. True to form, I followed the GPSr pointer through some bush, to a spot that was close, but nothing revealed itself at first. Then I just stood and looked. Sure enough, about 20 ft away a collection of wood looked, well, too human in configuration, so I made my way over to it and under that pile was the cache container, an ammo can. I sat for a while, signed the log, took pictures of the cache and savored the find. I felt truly thankful to the cache owner for having found this spot, hiding the cache and providing me with an excuse to come walking out here, a place were things just ARE, not maybe or sort of, but just are. I wrote that sentiment of thanks in the cache log later that evening and really meant it.\nI decided to snap away, creating a series of pictures in an attempt to try to capture the experience, to capture the moment. The pictures never really quite do capture the experience, but they are a valiant attempt at least. I remember being quite taken by the newly frozen water along the shoreline. Some of the pictures show the effects of the recent freeze: translucent water with bubbles and foliage trapped in what will be a solid state until spring: the first effects of a familiar cycle that has happened at this shoreline for countless centuries.\nOnce thriving grass now frozen solid in winter ice. These plants had that “fly in amber” quality to them. And if the shoreline plants had feelings and they did feel distressed at being trapped in the newly formed ice, the cycle that caused the distress will in turn free and nurture come Spring. Wounds will heal. The emotional wound I was expecting to feel as a short-lived relationship was promising to come to an end at that time, well, that wound would come, perhaps make me feel trapped and distressed for a while, but would also heal in the future as well. I don’t think I consciously thought of these things while I was on the spot, but in retrospect, this process of rethinking and writing about the experience is possibly revealing why I felt like the experience of the walk that day was cleansing me somehow. The new snow was the sign of a familiar cycle; the animal tracks were a sign of resilience, perhaps of coping with whatever new reality descends.\nAnd maybe this is simply a completely fabricated mental model painted on past experience, I honestly don’t know.\nI slowly, I remember, somewhat reluctantly made my way back to the trail and then to the car. The battery on the GPSr held out the whole way. I made it to Sherwood Park and stopped at the first gas station I saw to fill up on fuel and with that had reentered civilization with it’s own man-made cycles measured by the second, minutes and hours not by the millennia.\nPhotos from the day\u003e Photos from the day # ","date":"November 4, 2007","permalink":"/posts/blackfoot-hike-wanisan-lake/","section":"","summary":"A second visit to Cooking Lake – Blackfoot Recreational Area in two days. After a fresh snowfall, I broke trail to out of the way places that were brand new to me.","title":"Blackfoot Hike (Wanisan Lake)"},{"content":"The Cooking Lake Blackfoot Recreational Area was all completely new to me when I first decided to geocache in the area on November 3, 2007. There was a feeling of being able to explore the unknown, of not knowing what is around the next bend. I love this aspect of geocaching: the chance to “discovering” what for me is a new part of the world, and in this case so close to home, for the first time.\nParked in a freshly-snowed-on lot at the Waskahegan Staging Area I arrived late-ish morning, had that “Where the heck should I start?” feeling and then just headed out on what seemed to be the trailhead. My main aim of the day was to try to find all the caches in the area and I won’t give a blow by blow account of the each one; instead I’ll just mention a few glimmers of memory that stand out.\nOne of my first pictures of the morning was as I was approaching a cache from what turned out to be the single most difficult way one could ever want to approach. The picture is taken in a dense bit of bush and comes as a result of me laughing at myself asking the question, “What the HECK am I doing here, in the middle of nowhere? And why am I asking myself this question so early in the day?” This tends to happen about half the time: one gets to the cache by bushwhacking and wondering how anyone find such a place much less have the evil will to hide a cache in a place so hard to get to and find at the cache a perfectly nice trail leading back to the main path I was on and presenting an opening that was completely ignored. I joke that there’s a “Take single most difficult and round about route to cache” button on my GPSr.\nAfter that find, I proceeded to another cache close by. My receiver is set to beep 80 meters from the cache coordinates, and just as I’m passing a Mom with her two kids who are resting in one of the shelter huts, my pocket began to beep like crazy. Now this caching thing is supposed to be surreptitious to a point, so one doesn\u0026rsquo;t want to whip out the receiver in front of everyone as it kind of gives away what you\u0026rsquo;re up to. So as my pocket is beeping wildly I just say “Hi there!!” with a smile and the Mom says “Hi!” back with what I think is a knowing smile.\nThis next cache is right beside a trail, and on a hill no less. With no tree cover at all in the Fall, this kind of proximity to the trail makes a person completely exposed as the hunt for the cache goes on. I always mutter and curse in these situations because you have to keep on eye on searching for the cache, but also keep an eye on the trail to see if people are coming who will see you searching through the trees and grass and obviously immediately assume you’re picking up drugs or something like that. And the thing is with me these days that I’m really only working with one good eye, so the attention is split between the task at hand and the keeping watch. Anyway, I came up empty at that one: the frustration level builds to a point where one simply says, “Why, that is enough of that!” (well, that’s the clean version anyway) and moves on.\nThere were a few more caches found until I came to one whose hint promised that it would be under one of the rest huts along the path. This one was near the picture of the little squirrel on top of his little hill. I looked and looked and looked. No cache that I could see. I’m circling this hut four times, pretty much on my stomach the whole time. No cache. When I got back home I reported it as a “Did not find” and the owner said he’d check it out in the future. About a month later someone reported finding it though, so I guess somehow I just missed it.\nThe next cache of note was actually hidden on what is an island surrounded by swamp. Apparently there is a way in during the summer, but only if one jumps across to the island at one specific spot. The weather was on my side for this one: I just walked across the newly frozen water to the island. Even so, the approach to this one as a fairly significant bushwhack. After about 20 minutes of this kind of thing, one really wonders about the point of hacking through trees and searching like a ferret to get around fallen logs. But this kind of thinking also makes it kind of fun.\nI found the cache cleverly hidden inside the bark of a fallen tree, sat down for a little rest with some water and an energy bar and then proceeded to bushwhack out in a different direction from what I’d entered the area. I had already marked a waypoint on the main trail, and was heading for it, so I knew I was going the right direction. Even so, there were doubts.\nThe geocache container - this one is going to LAST! Finally I see the drainage trench I knew would be the close to the main trail and suddenly the trail appears and just as suddenly an older gentleman ambles directly toward me just as he is passing along that point on the trail. He looks at me with some incredulity; imagine walking on a quiet trail and suddenly some guy comes crashing out of the bush with a big “Hi!” and a smile. He had to wonder about my sanity. Funny, I was just thinking that about myself.\nI think I found one more cache after that one, but I have to tell you that bushwhack kind of tuckered me out. I was ready to get back to the car after what was then about a 4.5 hour hike. But not before going back to the scene of the cache on the little hill I couldn’t find. After a second search of the area, I finally found the silly thing very well hidden under a piece of bark no less. This little piece of bark had been stepped on a bunch of times, once by me I think. I felt lucky and a little perturbed.\nThat was it for the day. It was a good, tiring day with my first experience of that area of the Cooking Lake - Blackfoot area explored. When I got home and logged all my cache finds, I realized I had missed one cache. I completely walked by it. Drat.\nI decided to go back the next day to get that one cache, but more importantly to check out the Wanisan Lake area. Cache logs characterized it as being the “backdoor” to the Blackfoot area. That sounded exotic. And there were a couple of caches to be found.\nA Few Photos of the Hike\u003e A Few Photos of the Hike # ","date":"November 3, 2007","permalink":"/posts/blackfoot-geocaching-waskahegan/","section":"","summary":"A memorable day of geocaching in the Cooking Lake Blackfoot Recreational Area.
