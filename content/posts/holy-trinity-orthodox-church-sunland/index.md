The original settlers in the area around this church were Romanian Bucovinian ([https://www.britannica.com/place/Bukovina](https://www.britannica.com/place/Bukovina) ). Early services were held in homes. Although the cemetery was in use beginning 1907, land for the church was purchased in 1910 and the church built over 3 years, completed in 1913.

The nearby “bell-house” was built in following years at a cost of $350, the bells donated by parishioners. In 1962 the bell house was rebuilt and a parish hall was built nearby.
