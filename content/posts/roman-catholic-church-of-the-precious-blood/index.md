summary: "Although mass is only held here once a year, this church remains in pretty good shape."

A small church was built on this site in 1907 and then replaced by the current building, built in 1934-35. This makes it the oldest Polish parish in Alberta.

Although the paint and the steeple need some work, it seems to me this building stands tall and proud.

These days, mass and grave blessings are celebrated once a year here.
