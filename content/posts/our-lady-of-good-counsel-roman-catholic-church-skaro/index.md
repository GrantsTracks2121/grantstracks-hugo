The original church on this site was built from 1901 to 1904. A second, larger church was started in 1917 and completed the next year.

Between 1945-51 funding for a new church was gathered with the old church being dismantled in 1959 and a new church, the present structure, was completed in 1960.

This solid-looking red brick structure is an impressive sight indeed.
