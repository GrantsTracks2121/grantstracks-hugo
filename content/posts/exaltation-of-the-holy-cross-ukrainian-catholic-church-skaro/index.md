The original church on this site, then called “Ruthenian Greek Catholic Church of Chesnoho Khresta at Skaro”, was built from 1900 to 1917 and was destroyed by fire in 1942. The present church was built in 1945. The bell tower, however, is the original built in 1920.

This is a very impressive church, first because of its sheer size and how immaculately well-kept it is. Second, its design is distinctive in that it has four rooms added to the usual “cruciform” (i.e. “Cross”) structure at the corners of the building. On each of these form rooms is a small tower adding to the beauty of the building.

Many of the churches in the county are quaint and unassuming; not this one. When you see the structure and walk up the front steps you can’t help but get the feeling you are about to enter another realm. That's exactly what churches are **for**.
