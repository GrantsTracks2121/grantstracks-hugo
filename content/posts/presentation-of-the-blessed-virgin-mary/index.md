The land for this church was donated in 1911 and the church itself was built in 1917. The nearby bell tower was built in 1939.

Canada’s Historic Places website points out that, like many of the churches in Lamont County, the building is significant because of the “the transference of religious traditions in the building of churches and devotional expression of immigrants from eastern Galicia and northern Bukovyna, provinces in the Austro-Hungarian Empire, that are today located in Ukraine.”

In 1925, Peter Lapinski painted the interior. I didn't attempt to venture in during my visit, but [images of the beautiful interior can be found here.](http://www.historicplaces.ca/en/rep-reg/image-image.aspx?id=7921#i3)
