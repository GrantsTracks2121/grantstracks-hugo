Put this in so that links open in new windows

<base target="_blank">

A sample alert box - change out the "circle-info" to change the icon.

This also includes the way to link to other pages. Supply the folder name with an index.md

{{< alert "circle-info" >}}
[In Part 1, I introduced StoryMapJS]({{< relref "storymapjs-tutorial-part-1/index.md" >}}).

[In Part 2, I covered the process of building StoryMap slides.]({{< relref "storymapjs-part-2-building-a-storymap/index.md" >}})
{{< /alert >}}

Options for icons in the alert code:
- lightbulb
- link 
- list
- location-dot
- lock
- music
- pencil
- search
- sun
- triangle-exclamation
- wand-magic-sparkles

changes to blowfish core layouts

To include Rock Salt font for the Site name:

Added custom.css to /assets/css

Added this code to custom.css
~~~~
@font-face {
    font-family: RockSalt-Regular;
    src: url('/fonts/RockSalt-Regular.ttf');
}

.RockSalted {
    font-family: RockSalt-Regular;

}
~~~~

Now apply that class "RockSalted" to

/layouts/partials/header/fixed and
/layouts/partials/header/basic

For example, in fixed.html


Line 26 is where the site title gets created. Delete "text-base" and insert RockSalted

a href="{{ "" | relLangURL }}"
                            class="RockSalted font-medium text-gray-500 hover:text-gray-900">{{ .Site.Title | markdownify
                            | emojify }}</a>

line 38 in fixed.html is where ALL the header options are created.

class="text-base font-medium text-gray-500 hover:text-gray-900" title="{{ .Title }}">
change to:
class="RockSalted font-medium text-gray-500 hover:text-gray-900" title="{{ .Title }}">

it's line 29 in basic.html
